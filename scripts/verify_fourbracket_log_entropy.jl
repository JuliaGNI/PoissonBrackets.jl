# The singularity of the log-entropy weight (Section 5.1, Example 5.4).
#
#     julia --project=scripts scripts/verify_fourbracket_log_entropy.jl
#
# For S = int s(u), the weighted four-bracket of Section 5.1 generates
# {A,B}_S = 2 int Phi(u) [A_u,B_u] with Phi' = omega s' s''. Demanding the Lie-Poisson
# bracket, Phi = u/2, forces
#
#       omega = 1 / (2 s' s'') ,
#
# which for s = u log u is omega = u / (2 (1 + log u)), with a simple pole at u = 1/e where s'
# vanishes. Three claims settle whether that pole can be removed:
#
#   1. The pole is confined to the four-bracket. In the induced two-bracket the combination
#      omega * S_u * s'' is identically 1/2, so the pole is cancelled exactly by the zero of
#      S_u, and the Lie-Poisson bracket it generates is regular at u = 1/e -- even for fields
#      whose range straddles 1/e. The four-bracket, with four independent arguments, has no
#      such zero available and genuinely diverges. Refining the grid is what separates the two:
#      a genuine pole grows without bound as the grid resolves the curve u = 1/e, whereas a
#      merely large value settles.
#
#   2. No weight regular at the critical level can do the job. If s'(u*) = 0 and omega is C^1
#      near u*, the induced structure function obeys c'(u*) = 0, whereas the Lie-Poisson
#      bracket needs c' = 1 identically. So the pole is forced, not an artefact of a poor
#      choice of weight.
#
#   3. It can nonetheless be moved out of the way. int u is a Casimir of every bracket in the
#      family, so S may be shifted to s_alpha = u log u + alpha u without changing the bracket
#      generated. The critical level moves to u* = exp(-(1+alpha)), so on a state space whose
#      fields take values in a compact subinterval of (0, infinity), some alpha makes the
#      weight smooth on the whole range.
#
# This is the same obstruction the discrete Lie-Poisson brackets meet when the Casimir is
# prescribed -- see `verify_burgers_entropy_casimir.jl`, which finds the identical critical
# level u = 1/e from the structure-constant side -- seen here from the four-bracket side.
