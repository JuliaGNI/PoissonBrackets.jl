# Can regrouping the integrand restore the Jacobi identity of the second KdV bracket?
#
#     julia --project=scripts scripts/verify_kdv_jacobi_family.jl
#
# The second structure is 4u d_x + 2u_x - d_x^3 (in the textbook sign convention,
# -4u d_x - 2u_x - d_x^3). Its u-dependent part can be assembled in several ways that agree
# after integration by parts in the continuum but not discretely, giving a one-parameter
# family alpha T1 + beta T3. This asks whether any member of that family closes into a Lie
# algebra.
#
#   0. validation of the structure-constant routine on known controls;
#   1. the family has exactly one relation, T1 + T2 + T3 = 0;
#   2. antisymmetry forces alpha = 2 beta, and consistency then pins (4,2);
#   3. the Jacobiator splits by degree in u into a degree-2 Lie-algebra condition and a
#      degree-1 2-cocycle condition, both of order one and FLAT under refinement;
#   4. scanning beta/alpha over the whole family never brings either near zero.
#
# The index convention matches the package throughout: `C[m,i,j]` is c_ij^m, which is what
# `structure_constant_residual` and `jacobi_residual` already expect.
