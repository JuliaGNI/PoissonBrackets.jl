# multiplication. No Lie bracket is: for vector fields [f X, Y] = f [X,Y] - (Y f) X. This

#
# holds there exactly. Since the transformed bracket is
#
#     {A,B} = int Phi(ubar) [ h Fbar, h Gbar ] ,    h = 1/Phi'(ubar) ,
#
# (**) together with Phi/(Phi')^2 = const is necessary and sufficient for the transformed
# bracket to be independent of ubar, and the second condition forces Phi(ubar) = (a ubar + b)^2
# -- the square root, uniquely up to an affine reparametrisation.
#
# Finally it checks that (**) fails for vector fields in d > 1 and for the canonical (Vlasov)
# bracket, so Section 1 is specific to one-dimensional transport-type brackets.
#
# Needs SymPy, provisioned by CondaPkg through SymPyPythonCall.
