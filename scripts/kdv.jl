# The numerical experiments of the KdV manuscript: the relative error of BOTH Hamiltonians
# against time, and the initial and final states, for each of the standard cases.
#
#     julia --project=scripts scripts/kdv.jl [case ...]
#
# with cases `cos`, `soliton1`, `soliton2`, `soliton3`, `soliton5` and `miura`. With no
# arguments it runs all six. Per case it writes into scripts/figures/:
#
#   kdv-<case>-{H1,H2,C0}-flow1.pdf   the four flow-1 runs
#   kdv-<case>-{H1,H2,C0}-other.pdf   the two flow-2 runs, and the two Miura runs where
#                                     the case has them
#   kdv-state-<case>.pdf              initial and final states
#   <case>.md                         a table of the maximum error in each invariant
#
# In every case each geometric method holds the Hamiltonian generating its flow to round-off
# and lets the other drift by orders of magnitude more. RK4's error is the only one that
# genuinely grows, and on the narrow examples it also pays for the structure it lacks in
# step count.
#
# The `miura` case is different in kind from the other five and adds a THIRD vector field.
# It is posed in v, not in u, and it has to be: int u_h = int v_h^2, so the image of the
# discrete Miura map lies in C_0,d > 0, and none of the other five -- cos x has zero mass,
# the solitons are depressions -- has a preimage at all.
