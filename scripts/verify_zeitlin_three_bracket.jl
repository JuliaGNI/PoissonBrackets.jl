# Does the Bialynicki-Birula--Morrison three-bracket reproduce the Zeitlin bracket?
#
#     julia --project=scripts scripts/verify_zeitlin_three_bracket.jl
#
# Bialynicki-Birula and Morrison (1991) write a Lie-Poisson bracket as a Nambu three-bracket
# with a Casimir in the third slot,
#
#     [A, B, S] = {A, B} ,
#
# and the construction needs two hypotheses, both load-bearing:
#
#   (S) the algebra is SEMI-SIMPLE, so that the Killing form kappa is NON-DEGENERATE;
#   (Q) the Casimir in the third slot is the QUADRATIC one built from that form,
#       S = 1/2 sum kappa^mn w_m w_n, whose gradient is then kappa^-1 w.
#
# Note what (S) does NOT buy, because the obvious reading is wrong and this script asserted it
# in an earlier revision. The lowered structure constants c_ijk = sum_m c_ij^m kappa_mk are
# totally antisymmetric for EVERY Lie algebra, semi-simple or not: that is ad-invariance of the
# Killing form, kappa([x,y],z) + kappa(y,[x,z]) = 0, which holds unconditionally. Measured
# below, se(3) and so(3) with abelian directions both have a singular kappa and both give a
# (j,k) antisymmetry defect of exactly zero. Semi-simplicity is needed for kappa^-1 to exist,
# so that (Q)'s Casimir exists at all -- step 1, not step 2.
#
# Salmon (2005) section 5 reports that the method "fails even to capture the Nambu bracket
# (1.9)" -- the two-dimensional vorticity bracket -- because the continuum algebra of
# symplectic diffeomorphisms is neither semi-simple nor carries such a Casimir, and the
# integrals diverge. That is a statement about sdiff(T^2).
#
# The question here is whether the MATRIX TRUNCATION escapes it. Zeitlin's sine bracket
# replaces sdiff(T^2) by su(N), which is semi-simple, and Zeitlin's quadratic invariant
# I_2 = sum_k w_k w_{-k} is its Killing-form Casimir. Both hypotheses then hold on their
# face, so the mechanism ought to go through after truncation even though it does not before.
#
# This script decides that. Once kappa is invertible and S is its quadratic form, the identity
# [A, B, S] = {A, B} is kappa kappa^-1 = I and carries no information by itself -- so what the
# checks have to establish is that the hypotheses hold here and bite elsewhere:
#
#   1. kappa is non-degenerate for the sine algebra     -- hypothesis (S), and the real content
#   2. the lowered c_ijk is totally antisymmetric       -- an implementation check, NOT evidence
#      for (S); see the note above
#   3. kappa^mn is proportional to delta_{m+n,0}, i.e. Zeitlin's I_2 IS the Killing Casimir
#                                                       -- hypothesis (Q), the link to the paper
#   4. the three-bracket with S = I_2 reproduces the Zeitlin bracket exactly
#   5. NEGATIVE CONTROL for (Q): Zeitlin's cubic invariant I_3 in the third slot does not
#   6. NEGATIVE CONTROL for (S): se(3), where kappa is singular AND its degenerate directions
#      are non-central, so not even a pseudo-inverse recovers the bracket
#
# Steps 5 and 6 are the point of the script as much as steps 1-4. A positive result whose
# hypotheses were never shown to bite is not evidence that the hypotheses are what did the
# work.
#
# Step 6 is se(3) and not so(3) padded with abelian directions, which is the control this
# script first used and which does not bite: there kappa is singular, but the degenerate
# directions are central, so the bracket vanishes on them anyway and pinv(kappa) recovers J
# exactly (measured: max|B3 - J| = 0). se(3) has a rotation-translation bracket living on its
# degenerate directions, and there pinv recovers nothing at all. This is the same trap the `so3`
# docstring already warns about for Jacobi controls, in a second guise: a control that fails for
# a reason that does not generalise is no better than one that cannot fail.
