# The fields are the same in every script because reproducibility is the point: an identity
# that holds is expected to produce the same residual today as it did when the manuscript was
# written, and a residual that moves is then a signal rather than noise.  They were carried in
# three copies before this module existed, and `Cu` in a fourth as a local `c3`.
#
# Which resolutions a refinement uses is policy, not mathematics, so it lives here rather than
# in the package: `src/torus.jl` will build a grid at any `N`, and choosing 64 and 128 -- fine
# enough for the leading error term to dominate, coarse enough to stay quick -- is this
# manuscript's judgement, not something a library should impose.

    uu(g)

A positive field, ranging over `[2.1, 4.0]`.

Bounded away from zero so that ``u^{3/2}`` and ``\\log u`` are smooth, and bounded away from
``e^{-1}`` so that the log-entropy weight is regular on it — which is what makes it the
control against which `ustraddle` in `verify_fourbracket_log_entropy.jl` is read.  Its range
also misses every critical level ``e^{-(1+\\alpha)}`` of the shifted entropy except
``\\alpha = -2``, so the same field exhibits both the smooth and the singular case.
