# The convergence study behind the refinement checks of `verify_fourbracket_identities.jl`.
#
#     julia --project=scripts scripts/verify_fourbracket_convergence.jl
#
# Six of the manuscript's identities involve fields that are not band-limited -- the quotient
# A_u/S_u, the powers u^{3/2}, the logarithm log u -- so Fourier differentiation is not exact
# for them and their residuals are discretisation error rather than a defect of the identity.
# What certifies such an identity is the rate: the residual must fall at the design order of
# the stencil as the grid is refined, and an identity that were merely approximate would
# stall at its own error instead.
#
# Each row is measured at N = 32, 64, 128 and 256, and the observed order is the base-two
# logarithm of successive ratios.  A row passes if the finest residual has reached roundoff,
# or if the last transition still shows at least 6th-order behaviour -- the margin against the
# design order of 8 absorbs the constant in the leading error term, which is not close to one
# for the quotient identities.
#
# Observed orders run from 7.2 to 8.1, so the 8th-order stencil is behaving and the identities
# hold.  Rows 1 and 2 are pointwise, the remaining four are integrated.
