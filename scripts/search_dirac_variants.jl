# Search for a variant of the Dirac construction that restores the Jacobi identity.
#
#     julia --project=scripts scripts/search_dirac_variants.jl
#
# `verify_dirac_reduction.jl` establishes that the construction as stated does not work, and
# why: the Jacobiator transports tensorially through the Dirac projector,
#
#     [Jhat,Jhat]^ijk = P^i_l P^j_m P^k_n [J,J]^lmn ,        P = Pi_V1 R ,
#
# so Dirac reduction can only CREATE the Jacobi identity if [J,J] lands in ker P^{ox 3}, a
# subspace of dimension dim V2. That kernel is not empty, so the question is whether some
# variant of the construction aims into it. This searches, in order of prize:
#
#   B1  Repair the fine block. The coarse block c_ij^m, i,j in V1, is EXACT -- that is the
#       whole point of the hierarchical basis -- while [V1,V2] and [V2,V2] were truncated and
#       are therefore free. Is there a Lie algebra structure on V1 + V2 restricting to the
#       exact bracket on V1 x V1?
#         B1a  graded ansatz, exact.
#         B1b  the V1^3 equations alone, exact: they are LINEAR in [V2,V1].
#         B1c  ungraded, numerically, by Gauss-Newton onto the Lie-algebra variety.
#   B2  Deform the constraint surface: phi_a = u_a + sum_{i in V1} B_ai u_i, a linear shear.
#   B3  Choose V2 differently: every even-sized subset of a larger shell, with abelian
#       padding. Exhaustive and exact.
#   B4  Nested reduction. Ruled out by the composition lemma; see the verifier.
#
# Findings, in brief: B1a is flatly inconsistent from K=2 on, and its one solution at K=1 has
# [V2,V2] = 0, hence C = 0 and no Dirac bracket. B1b is consistent, so the obstruction is not
# in the coarse equations. B1c finds solutions at K=1 -- where V1 = sl(2) is already a
# subalgebra -- and none at K=2. B2 and B3 find nothing beyond the three-dimensional
# degeneracy at K=1.
#
# EXPLORATORY AND SLOW, and deliberately not part of run_all.jl. Only B1a needs SymPy; B1b
# and B3 are exact rational arithmetic and B1c and B2 are floating-point optimisation.

header("Conclusion")
println("""   No variant of the construction restores the Jacobi identity, and the
   verifier explains why in one sentence: closure by truncation and
   second-classness of the fine block exclude each other.

     * Closure requires a non-negative additive grading, which makes the high
       block an ideal.  Then Sigma is a Poisson submanifold, the PLAIN restriction
       is already Lie-Poisson -- and C = 0, so there is no Dirac bracket to form,
       and none is needed.
     * Whenever C is invertible the fine block is not an ideal, the truncation is
       not closed, and the projector identity forbids the reduction from repairing
       what the truncation broke.

   B2 deserves a footnote of its own.  Minimising over the shear has no minimiser:
   the infimum is approached only as |B| -> infinity, with cond(J22) and max|Jhat|
   diverging along the way, i.e. as the constraints cease to be second class.  The
   sequence is leaving the domain on which a Dirac bracket exists, not converging
   to a solution -- which is the singular hypersurface of the notes reappearing as
   the boundary of the admissible set.  Note also the two-sided trap: an
   unnormalised residual can be driven to zero by shrinking Jhat, and one
   normalised by max|Jhat|^2 by blowing Jhat up.  Report |B|, cond(J22) and
   max|Jhat| alongside the residual, and re-evaluate at points not used in the
   fit.

   What survives is in section 6 of verify_dirac_reduction.jl: the family of
   Theorem 2.1 is closed under Dirac reduction, acting by K -> Schur(K); and
   Dirac reduction of an honest Lie-Poisson bracket, the sine bracket in
   particular, gives an exactly Poisson but non-Lie-Poisson bracket on a coarse
   mode set.""")
