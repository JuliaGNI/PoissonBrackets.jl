# Can Zeitlin-style aliasing restore the Jacobi identity of the second KdV bracket?
#
#     julia --project=scripts scripts/verify_kdv_aliasing.jl
#
# No. Zeitlin's construction replaces a Fourier truncation of the sine-Euler bracket by
# structure constants that are PERIODIC IN THE GRADING,
#
#     c_{mn}^{m+n} = (N/2pi) sin( (2pi/N) m x n ) ,     m + n modulo N ,
#
# so that reducing the index mod N is invisible: sin is unchanged by m x n -> m x n + N. The
# second KdV bracket is the Virasoro Lie-Poisson structure, whose structure constants are
# m - n: linear and unbounded. No N-periodic function agrees with m - n across a window of
# width N without an O(N) jump at the seam, and that jump is precisely the aliasing error.
#
#   1. aliasing is not even definable in a spline basis: it needs a multiplicative grading
#      phi_m phi_n in span{phi_{m+n}}, which B-splines do not have and Fourier modes do;
#   2. in a Fourier basis the second bracket is exactly Virasoro,
#      P_mn = (m-n) u_{m+n} + c m^3 delta_{m+n,0};
#   3. THE ZERO-MODE THEOREM. For any Z_N-graded ansatz [L_m,L_n] = f(m,n) L_{m+n}, setting
#      m = 0 in the graded Jacobi condition gives, identically,
#
#          J(0,n,p) = f(n,p) [ phi(n) + phi(p) - phi(n+p) ] ,   phi(n) := f(0,n).
#
#      So phi must be additive wherever the bracket is nonzero. If f(n,p) != 0 for all n != p
#      -- which consistency with m - n forces -- then for N >= 5 additivity over Z_N forces
#      phi == 0, i.e. L_0 CENTRAL, whereas consistency demands phi(n) -> -n. The sole
#      exception is N = 3, whose nondegenerate solution has a nondegenerate Killing form and
#      is therefore sl(2,C), the unique three-dimensional simple Lie algebra -- and three
#      modes cannot converge;
#   4. why Zeitlin escapes: the sine algebra is graded by Z_N^2 minus the origin, the zero
#      mode being simply absent, and legitimately so, because constants are already central
#      in C^inf(T^2). Its phi vanishes identically. Witt's L_0 is the grading element and
#      cannot be dropped, since [L_n,L_-n] = 2n L_0;
#   5. a second, independent obstruction: the -d_x^3 term is the Virasoro cocycle, which is
#      not a coboundary, while every candidate target here is semisimple and so has H^2 = 0
#      by Whitehead's lemma.
#
# Needs SymPy.
