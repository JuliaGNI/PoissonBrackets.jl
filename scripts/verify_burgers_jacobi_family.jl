# Theorem: J_ij(u) = g_i(u_i) K_ij g_j(u_j) is a Poisson tensor.
#
#     julia --project=scripts scripts/verify_burgers_jacobi_family.jl
#
# The hypotheses that are actually needed, and that the statement of the theorem in the notes
# left implicit:
#
#   (i)  K is a *constant* antisymmetric matrix, independent of u;
#   (ii) each g_i is a function of u_i ALONE.
#
# The special case g_i(u_i) = sqrt(u_i) is the Burgers bracket of Section 1. This script
# verifies the theorem exactly and shows that both hypotheses are sharp: relax either and the
# Jacobi identity fails.
#
# It also verifies the Casimirs C_n = sum_i n_i G_i(u_i) with G_i' = 1/g_i, for every n in
# ker K.
#
# Exact rational arithmetic throughout, so "the residual vanishes" means it is zero and not
# that it is smaller than a tolerance someone chose.

J_ij = g_i K_ij g_j together with dJ[l,i,j] = ∂J_ij/∂u_l, where `dg[i,l]` is ∂g_i/∂u_l.

Written out rather than taken from `GaugedBracket`, which carries a single scalar `g`
applied componentwise; the point of sections 1 and 3 is to let g_i vary with the index, and
then to let it depend on components other than its own.
