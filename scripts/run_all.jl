# Run every verification script.  Exits nonzero if any check fails.
#
#     julia --project=scripts scripts/run_all.jl [script ...]
#
# With no arguments it runs the whole suite, in the order below: the KdV scripts follow the
# sections of `discrete-kdv-brackets-notes.tex`, the Burgers and Lie-Poisson ones those of
# `discrete-lie-poisson-brackets.tex` and its Dirac companion, the four-bracket ones those of
# `poisson-brackets-from-four-brackets.tex`.  Naming each script after the bracket it diagnoses
# is what keeps the three manuscripts apart in one flat directory.
#
# Each script runs in its own process, so a failure -- or an `exit(1)` from `summary` -- is
# contained and reported rather than taking the runner down with it.  The symbolic scripts
# need SymPy, which CondaPkg provisions on first use; the rest are pure Julia.
#
# `search_dirac_variants.jl` is exploratory and slow, and is deliberately excluded, exactly
# as it is from the `run_all.sh` it replaces.  Run it by hand.
#
# The seven scripts under `fable/` are also excluded, and for a different reason: they are
# verification scripts on the same footing as these, but `fable/III4_multifield_derivative.jl`
# alone takes about eleven minutes.  They have their own driver, `scripts/run_fable.sh`.
