# Prescribing the Casimir: entropy-adapted discrete Poisson brackets.
#
#     julia --project=scripts scripts/verify_burgers_entropy_casimir.jl
#
# Theorem 2.1 is the discrete counterpart of the one-component Dubrovin-Novikov family of
# hydrodynamic-type Poisson brackets. The correspondence rests on the factorisation
#
#     J_G = G(u) d_x + 1/2 G'(u) u_x = sqrt(G) . d_x . sqrt(G)          (continuum)
#     J   = diag(g) K diag(g) ,          g_i = sqrt(G_i)                (discrete)
#
# -- multiplication, a CONSTANT anti-symmetric operator, multiplication. In one field
# component every metric G > 0 is flat, so every such bracket is Poisson; the discrete
# statement is Theorem 2.1, and the flat coordinate is the same in both cases,
# ubar = int du / sqrt(G).
#
# The practical consequence is that one does not choose g and then discover the Casimir --
# one prescribes the Casimir density eta and it DETERMINES g:
#
#     eta'(u) = 1 / g(u) .
#
# Choosing eta(u) = u log u therefore makes the logarithmic entropy an exact Casimir by
# construction, with g(u) = 1/(log u + 1).
#
#   1. the prescription eta' = 1/g works for arbitrary eta, exactly, and the entropy case;
#   2. the continuum factorisation and the continuum Casimir rule c' = 1/sqrt(G);
#   3. the singularity at eta'(u) = 0 is INTRINSIC -- no additive normalisation removes it;
#   4. the alternative route: for a Lie-Poisson bracket built from a matrix Lie algebra,
#      EVERY spectral function tr(eta(W)) is a Casimir, so the logarithmic entropy comes for
#      free and without any singularity.
#
# Sections 1-4 need SymPy. Section 5 does not: so(N) and its structure constants are exact
# rational arithmetic, which `so_n` in the package already does, so the CAS is dropped there.
