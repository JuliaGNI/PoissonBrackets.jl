# Proposition 2.1: the metriplectic two-bracket induced by a Kulkarni-Nomizu product of two
# symmetric positive semi-definite tensors is itself positive semi-definite.
#
#     julia --project=scripts scripts/verify_fourbracket_metriplectic.jl
#
# The proof in the manuscript is analytic -- Cauchy-Schwarz followed by AM-GM. This script is
# an independent Monte-Carlo cross-check of it, in three parts:
#
#   1. That `metriplectic_bracket` implements equation (2.6). The closed form it evaluates in
#      O(n^2) is checked against the O(n^4) contraction of the four-index tensor
#      `kulkarni_nomizu` builds from the definition, so that what follows is known to be
#      testing the proposition rather than a convenient rearrangement of it.
#
#   2. The proposition itself, swept over dimension and over every combination of ranks --
#      full, rank-one, and deficient on either side. The singular cases are the point: an
#      inequality chain is likeliest to fail where its terms degenerate, and a sweep over
#      definite tensors only would never reach them.
#
#   3. That the hypothesis is not decoration. Drop semi-definiteness for a merely symmetric
#      indefinite sigma and negative values must appear -- otherwise the proposition would be
#      vacuous and the sweep above would be evidence for nothing.
#
# Finite-dimensional and unlike the rest of the manuscript's material: no grid, no fields.
# Both seeds are fixed, so a failure is reproducible.
