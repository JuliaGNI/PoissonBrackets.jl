# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Test suite reorganised to mirror the `src/` directory structure, with test files in
  `test/equations/`, `test/quality/`, etc. Each test file is a module with isolated
  test sets via SafeTestsets, selected by test groups `core` and `slow` (chosen via
  `ARGS`); `test/integrators.jl` and the doctests run in the `slow` group. The test
  environment is `test/Project.toml`. Only Aqua and Test moved there, from `[extras]` and
  `[targets]` in `Project.toml`, without compat bounds. Documenter and
  SafeTestsets are new test dependencies. LinearAlgebra, Random, SimpleSolvers,
  SimpleSplines and SparseArrays are test dependencies that stay in the `[deps]` of
  `Project.toml`. A new `test/quality/doctests.jl` runs the doctests. Shared test data
  `SPLINE_MESHES` moved to `test/helpers/meshes.jl`; each test file that draws from the
  global random number generator seeds it itself. Total test count unchanged (1720 in 24
  files, plus one new doctest testset).

## [0.1.2] — 2026-09-24

This patch release changes and removes API because 0.1.1 was released the same day,
and no package outside this repository depends on these names in a registered release.

### Fixed

`Arakawa(nx, nv, hx, hv)` accepts spacings of any `Real` types; the element type is
that of `inv(hx) * inv(hv) / 12`. In 0.1.1 integer spacings threw `InexactError` and
mixed types a `MethodError`.

### Changed

- `PoissonTensor` and `PoissonOperator` indexing off the grid throws `BoundsError`
  (was `AssertionError` from `@assert`, which may be compiled out). Both the
  `CartesianIndex` and the linear-index methods of `PoissonTensor` check;
  `PoissonOperator` uses `checkbounds`.
- `PoissonOperator(tensor, h)` throws `DimensionMismatch` when `length(h)` is not
  `nx * nv`.
- `Array(pt)` materialises a `PoissonTensor`, and `Matrix(po)` a `PoissonOperator`
  (it is an `AbstractMatrix`). The two `Base.materialize` methods are removed,
  because `Base.materialize` is not public Base API. Note for callers:
  `Base.materialize(x)` now falls back to Base's identity and returns the lazy
  object itself rather than an error.
- `_apply_P_h!` and `_apply_P_ϕ!` are no longer exported (leading-underscore
  internals; reach them as `GeometricBrackets._apply_P_h!` or by explicit `using
  GeometricBrackets: _apply_P_h!`). This also removes the name clash with
  ReducedBasisMethods, which exports the same names in its released versions.
  `PoissonTensor` and `PoissonOperator` stay exported and now have docstrings, shown
  on the library page.
- `_apply_P_h!` throws `DimensionMismatch` unless `Pf`, `f` and `h` have length
  `nx * ny`, the number of grid nodes, and `ArgumentError` if any input has
  non-1-based indexing. It checked only that the three lengths were equal, so its
  `@inbounds` loop read and wrote past the end of equally short vectors. The
  tests cover the length checks of `_apply_P_h!` and `_apply_P_ϕ!`.
- `poisson_apply(::Arakawa, û, c)` evaluates `hx·hv·[c, û]` with `_apply_P_h!`;
  same values to rounding, about two orders of magnitude faster at n = 64 and n = 256,
  allocating only its output.
- `size(::PoissonTensor)` infers a concrete `NTuple{3, Int}`; `PoissonOperator`
  indexing no longer allocates a neighbour vector per entry.

### Removed

- Dependencies `OffsetArrays` and `MultiIndexArrays`. The Arakawa sign tables are
  one plain `Array{Int,4}` (their sum, the only way they were read); the 3 × 3
  periodic stencil of `PoissonOperator` and the linear-to-Cartesian conversion are
  written in the package with `CartesianIndices`, so no non-public name of another
  package is used.
- The uncalled helpers `inc`, `dec` and the collision stencils `_apply_C!`,
  `_apply_Cρ!`, `_apply_Cρ²!`, `_apply_Δᵥ!` (never exported, no caller, no test).

### Corrections to the 0.1.1 entry

- `PoissonTensor`/`PoissonOperator` are not a "weak form": `PoissonOperator * g` is
  the bracket at the grid nodes with no `hx·hv` quadrature weight. `PoissonTensor`
  holds `T` with `[g, h]_I = Σ_{J,K} T[I,J,K] g_J h_K`.
- The Jacobi band "0.50–0.74 over 40 random states" is one sample; the
  state-independent figure is `structure_constant_residual(poisson_derivative(b, û))
  == 0.5` on n × n grids, n = 5..8, now asserted in the tests.
- "a test on a 5 × 3 grid pins every index bound" overstated the coverage in 0.1.1;
  the tests now cover every index check of both types.

Tests added: real-typed spacings, `_apply_P_ϕ!` against `_apply_P_h!`, the 0.5
structure-constant residual, `Array(pt)` contracted against the independent Jacobian,
and the `BoundsError`/`DimensionMismatch` cases.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-24

### Added — the grid-based Arakawa bracket, a `DiscreteBracket` on a finite-difference grid

Moved in from ReducedBasisMethods' `src/gridbased/`. Three files arrive:

- `src/arakawa.jl` — `Arakawa(nx, nv, hx, hv)`, Arakawa's discretisation of the canonical
  bracket on a doubly periodic `nx × nv` grid. It is a `DiscreteBracket` in Lie-Poisson form,
  `P(f)_{JK} = hx·hv·Σ_I f_I A(I,J,K)`, linear in the grid state: `poisson_apply` contracts the
  3 × 3 stencil and assembles no matrix, and `poisson_derivative` is the constant tensor
  `hx·hv·A`. The assembled matrix satisfies `P == -P'` bit for bit. The Jacobi identity does
  not hold: `jacobi_residual` is of order one and flat under refinement, 0.50–0.74 over 40
  random states on grids of 5 to 8 nodes a side. Called as `arakawa(I, J, K)`, it returns the
  stencil coefficient that one passes to `PoissonTensor` as its `f`. The constructor refuses a
  grid with fewer than 3 nodes in a direction, where the two neighbours of a node coincide.
- `src/poisson_tensors.jl` — `PoissonTensor`, an `N × N × N` tensor discretising the weak
  form of `g[f,h]` on an `nx × nv` phase-space grid, and `PoissonOperator`, the weak form of
  `f ↦ [f,h]` for a fixed Hamiltonian. Both index lazily through a stencil, so neither
  materialises until `Base.materialize` is called.
- `src/bracket_operators.jl` — `_apply_P_h!` and `_apply_P_ϕ!`, the same bracket applied
  matrix-free to a vector, plus the Lenard-Bernstein-style collision stencils `_apply_C!`,
  `_apply_Cρ!`, `_apply_Cρ²!` and `_apply_Δᵥ!` that shared the file.

The bodies in `poisson_tensors.jl` and `bracket_operators.jl` are byte-identical to their
source, except the three index assertions of `PoissonTensor`, which test
`I in CartesianIndices((nx, nv))` where the source called a pirated `Base.isvalid`.

New dependencies: `OffsetArrays`, for the Arakawa sign tables, and `MultiIndexArrays` 0.1.1
(JuliaGNI/MultiIndexArrays.jl#2), which owns `multiindex` and `_stencil_indices`. Its
`linearindex` bounds the second component by `nv`, where the ReducedBasisMethods copy
checked `i ≤ nv`; a test on a 5 × 3 grid pins every index bound.

No type piracy: Aqua's check is clean, and the two `Base.materialize` overloads dispatch on
the package's own types.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-21

The first registered release. Everything below shipped in it: the package was developed in the
open against `main` and never carried a released version before this one, so what had been kept
under `[Unreleased]` is folded in here rather than held back. The KdV sign convention recorded
below is part of that fold, and it changes what every number in the package means — read it
before comparing any figure against an earlier working copy.

### Added — `pinv` inverts the torus derivative on the modes that have one

`pinv(g::TorusGrid)` returns the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of the grid's differentiation
matrix. `pinv(g) * f` is the zero-mean field whose `∂x` is `f`, and `f * transpose(pinv(g))` does
the same in `y`, mirroring how `∂y` mirrors `∂x`. Both schemes are served by the one method.

`D` is singular, and by two modes rather than one. A constant has no derivative on a periodic
domain, and at even `N` neither does the Nyquist mode: `spectral_grid`'s `D` carries no Nyquist
component by construction, and every centred stencil has symbol `2i Σ c_k sin(kθ) / h`, which
vanishes at `θ = π`. So `D` has rank `N - 2`, `D⁺D` is the projector onto the complement of those
two modes, and a field with a constant-in-`x` part comes back without it. That is what "pseudo"
costs here, and it is the only thing it costs.

It is built from the circulant structure rather than by an SVD. Only the first column of `D` is
needed to recover the eigenvalues, so the cost is `O(N²)` rather than the `O(N³)` of a general
`pinv`. The result is dense even for the sparse finite-difference `D`, which is not a loss:
recovering a field from its derivative is global, and no banded matrix performs it.

Checked against `LinearAlgebra.pinv` of the dense matrix to 1e-12, and against all four
Moore–Penrose conditions, for both schemes.

### Changed — the package is renamed to GeometricBrackets

`PoissonBrackets` becomes `GeometricBrackets`, and the repository becomes
`JuliaGNI/GeometricBrackets.jl`. The name said Poisson, but the package carries metric
brackets, collision brackets, four-brackets and metriplectic flows as well, so the old name
described a part of it.

What a caller changes: `using PoissonBrackets` becomes `using GeometricBrackets`, and a
`[deps]` or `[sources]` entry changes its key and its url. **The UUID does not change**, so a
manifest keeps resolving to the same package. The package extension is renamed with the
module, `PoissonBracketsMakieExt` to `GeometricBracketsMakieExt`; loading `CairoMakie` still
brings in the same plot methods.

The documentation moves to `https://JuliaGNI.github.io/GeometricBrackets.jl`. GitHub redirects
the old repository url, so an existing clone keeps fetching, but its `origin` should be
repointed.

The entries below this one were written under the old name and keep it.

### Changed — the export list says which names are the interface

Three names the package obliges someone else to use, and promised none of them.

**`field`** is the `DiscreteSpace` interface method `field(s, û, d)`, defined on the abstract
type and overridden by `TensorSplineSpace`. The package's own tests had to write
`PoissonBrackets.field` fourteen times across seven files, and `MetriplecticRelaxation`
imports it from this package's internals — no other package defines it, so there was nowhere
public to take it from. That is the `space` symptom recorded below, seen from the other side: a
downstream package depending on a name that could be renamed without notice. The fix belongs
here, not downstream.

**`metric_directional`** is documented as an override point — "the generic method here does
form the tensor, so a bracket that defines only the three interface methods still has a correct
Jacobian" — and `@autodocs` publishes it, while the tests and
`scripts/verify_metriplectic_flow.jl` had to qualify it.

**`bracket`** is the accessor a foreign flow must answer. `_poisson_bracket(f::AbstractFlow) =
bracket(f)` exists precisely so that a flow defined elsewhere reports a missing accessor rather
than a `FieldError`, which obliges that flow to define `PoissonBrackets.bracket`. It gains the
docstring `checkdocs = :exports` requires, and it says what the other accessors do not: a flow
need not have a Poisson half, so this is **not** one of the three `AbstractFlow` methods.

**`weighted_matrix`, `derivative_matrix` and `stiffness_matrix` are one generic each again.**
All three are exported by SimpleSplines and were given methods here without being imported, so
each was a *different* function under the same name and `using PoissonBrackets, SimpleSplines`
left all three ambiguous — a bare `stiffness_matrix` after that `using` raises `UndefVarError`
saying so. They join `mixed_matrix` in the import list. The invariant is now checkable and
holds: among the names both packages export, **none** resolves to two different bindings.

```julia
[n for n in intersect(names(PoissonBrackets), names(SimpleSplines))
 if getfield(PoissonBrackets, n) !== getfield(SimpleSplines, n)]   # Symbol[]
```

Extending a foreign generic is piracy unless the method dispatches on a type defined here, so
the two facts travel together: all twelve methods added to the three generics take a
`DiscreteSpace`, a `TensorSplineSpace` or a `PolarSplineSpace`, and `Aqua.Piracy` says so
rather than the author.

One visible consequence in the manual: the three docstrings move from `PoissonBrackets.x` to
`SimpleSplines.x` anchors, which is where `mixed_matrix`, `basis_values` and every other
imported generic already sat. The text is unchanged and every `@ref` still resolves, but a
permalink into one of the three changes.

`l2_projection` leaves the import list. Nothing in `src/`, `test/`, `docs/` or `scripts/` uses
it, and an import is the one thing that makes `PoissonBrackets.l2_projection` resolve for a
caller who should be asking SimpleSplines.

### Fixed — a conditional whose branches were identical

`_step!(û, ::ProjectionMethod, integ)` read `if isexplicit(method.base); _step!(û,
method.base, integ); else; _step!(û, method.base, integ); end`. The implicit branch once
inlined the Newton solve; when that moved into `_step!(û, ::IntegratorMethod, integ)` the two
branches became the same call, and dispatch on the base method already separates the explicit
step from the solver one. The conditional is gone and `isexplicit` keeps both its other
callers: the `Integrator` constructor, and the `ProjectionMethod` method that forwards to
`isexplicit(m.base)`.

Two docstrings recorded their own history — "as an earlier version did", "as an earlier version
of this docstring and of `verify_burgers_discretisation.py` both did". The mechanism each was
attached to is present tense and stays: scaling only the first residual block makes `cond(J)`
200 to 1700 times worse, and pairing `2√u` with `𝕂/4` makes the flow four times too slow where
no conservation test can see it.

### Changed — the memoised tables say they are the cache

`basis_values` and `mixed_matrix` on a `TensorSplineSpace` hand back the memoised matrix
itself, so a caller that mutates one corrupts every later call on that space. Only the `D = 1`
branch of `basis_values` copied, and its comment names a different hazard — `foldl` over a
one-element tuple returning the *quadrature's* own table. Both docstrings now state the
aliasing, and the new one-axis testset pins the `D = 1` copy.

`_collision_operator_derivative` recomputed the diffusion tensor and the weight `ϱ = ρM` on
each of the `N` columns of `metric_derivative` and `metric_directional`. They depend on the
state and not on the perturbation, so they join the cross factors that both callers already
hoist. The output is bit-identical. The saving is **a tenth of a per cent** of
`metric_directional` — the `N` hoisted passes against the whole call, at `N = 100` on
`TensorSplineSpace((10,10),3)` with a Λ-generated bracket, measured in one process and quoted
as a ratio because the absolute times are a statement about the machine. So this removes dead
work from the innermost Newton loop and is not a speedup; the before and after timings differ
by less than the run-to-run spread.

### Added — a testset for the one-axis `TensorSplineSpace`

`D = 1` had no coverage at all. The reference is `SplineSpace(10, 3)` rather than a
recomputation of the tensor assembly, so two code paths are compared instead of one with
itself, and they agree **exactly**: the mass and stiffness matrices, both basis-value tables,
`mixed_matrix((1,),(1,))`, `tensor_weighted_matrix` with `𝔻 = I` and `field` are equal to the
last bit, because on one axis the Kronecker product has a single factor and no arithmetic
happens. The testset also pins the memo (one object per multi-index), the `D = 1` copy (equal
to the quadrature's table, never the same object), `M⁻¹M ≈ I`, and a `ProjectorBracket`
degeneracy residual of 2.9e-16.

### Added — an Aqua baseline, which this package had never had

`test/aqua_tests.jl` runs `Aqua.test_all(PoissonBrackets)` as the first testset, and `Aqua`
joins `[extras]`, `[targets]` and `[compat]`, in the shape SimpleSplines, SimpleSolvers and
CompactBasisFunctions all use. Those three are dependencies of this package, and this package
had nothing, so its whole-package properties had never been checked at all.

**Piracy is why it matters here in particular.** The assembly interface extends SimpleSplines
generics rather than defining its own, which is what keeps `using` both packages unambiguous —
and every one of those methods is piracy unless it dispatches on a type defined here. That is a
line the behavioural suite is structurally unable to see, and it gets crossed by adding one
method to a shared generic, which is exactly what this change does three times over.

All eight checks `Aqua.test_all` enables by default pass on the first run, and
`test/aqua_tests.jl` excludes none of them: method ambiguity, unbound type parameters,
undefined exports, `Project.toml` against `test/Project.toml`, stale dependencies, compat
bounds, piracy and persistent tasks. Aqua 0.8.18 has a ninth, `undocumented_names`, which
`test_all` itself defaults to `false`. Seven of the eight can fail. The
`Project.toml`/`test/Project.toml` comparison exists only to support Julia below 1.2, so a
`julia = "1.11"` compat returns from it before it compares anything, and this package keeps
its test dependencies in `[extras]` and `[targets]` rather than in a `test/Project.toml` in
any case. Undefined exports is the one that would have caught an export list naming something
that does not exist.

### Fixed — `CollisionBracket` is now frame-covariant on a mapped domain

`CollisionBracket` was not frame-covariant. Its assembly read the space's own derivative tables,
which are parameter derivatives `∂̂`, and it assembled against those tables unchanged. On an
unmapped domain those *are* the physical derivatives, so every §5.4 run and the Grad-Shafranov
box were and remain correct. On a mapped domain with Jacobian `J`, the physical gradient is
`∇_x = J⁻ᵀ ∇̂`, and the bracket assembled in the wrong frame — `∂̂` instead of `J⁻ᵀ ∂̂` —
produces wrong numbers while still passing every structural check.

**The four things that move.** The bracket now takes an optional third positional argument,

```julia
CollisionBracket(space, Λ, pb::PulledBack; mobility, mobility_derivative)
```

which supplies the measure `m = ρ|det J|`, the frame `J⁻ᵀ`, the plain physical mass matrix
`∫Φ_K Φ_L |det J| dx̂` (not `ρ|det J|`), and the physical quadrature nodes `F(x̂_q)` where a
mobility `M(x, u)` is sampled. The keyword form with `density` is unchanged and remains right on
unmapped domains.

1. The assembly's derivative tables become `∇_x Φ_K = J⁻ᵀ ∇̂ Φ_K`.
2. Perping does not commute with a general linear change of coordinates: the perpendicular
   gradient `β = (∇φ)⊥` is a *direction*, not a rescaled one, so `J⁻ᵀ ∇̂φ` and then perp.
3. The local tensor coefficient is conjugated `J⁻¹ 𝔻 J⁻ᵀ`, and the mass sandwich uses the
   plain physical mass matrix `∫Φ_K Φ_L |det J| dx̂` rather than the space's parameter-measure one.
   This keeps energy conservation structural: `𝔾 ∂H/∂û = 0` holds exactly when the `𝕄` of the
   sandwich is the `𝕄` the caller's `∂H/∂û` carries.
4. A `mobility` function is sampled at the physical points `F(x̂_q)` rather than at the parameter
   nodes, so `M = Cr² + D` is written in the coordinates it belongs to.

New non-exported type `MappedFrame` holds the four things together so they cannot be applied to
three places out of four. New exports on `PulledBack`: `frame(pb)`, the inverse transpose Jacobian
`J⁻ᵀ` at the quadrature nodes, and `volume_element(pb)`, the plain `|det J|` — `measure(pb)` is
`ρ|det J|` and cannot be divided back down. `_mass_sandwich` gained a method taking a
factorisation directly.

**Structural checks cannot see this.** Symmetry, positive semi-definiteness and the degeneracy
`(F,H) = 0` are algebraic properties of `Q₂(z) = z⊥⊗z⊥` and of its annihilation of `z`; they
say nothing about which `z` was handed in, and they hold in every parametrisation. A bracket
assembled in the wrong frame passes all of them. The check that does discriminate is covariance:
the same physical problem written in two parametrisations must give the same operator.

**Covariance under a linear reparametrisation**, one physical problem on `[1,2]×[0,1]` written
as `F_a(x̂) = (x̂₁ + σ a x̂₂, a x̂₂)` on `[1,2]×[0,1/a]`. The physical domain, the physical basis
and the coefficient vector are independent of `a`. With `σ = 0` and unit density this reproduces
the plain-bracket case: `∫u dx` identical to twelve figures at **0.4053744627**, the frameless
bracket's norm in the ratio **1 : 16 : 256** at scales 1, 2, 4 — the fourth power — and the
framed bracket invariant to **6.1e-16**. With a shear `σ = 0.7`, a `1/r` density and a
state-dependent mobility, the framed bracket is invariant to **3.1e-16** while the frameless one
differs by **1.50e+01** and **2.55e+02**, and by **3.674e-01** relative to the framed bracket at
scale 1.

But a linear family is necessary and not sufficient. A reparametrisation that preserves a spline
space is affine, so `J` is constant, and for a constant `J` the whole bracket collapses to
`(det J⁻ᵀ)²` times the parameter-frame one. So a linear family tests `|det J|` and the pairing
and says **nothing about the direction**: a transposed frame passes the linear test exactly, at
**2.3e-16**, recorded as a control that cannot fail rather than left as an assumption.

**The check that does reach the direction**, on an annulus `r ∈ [0.4,1.3]` where `J` varies:
`metric_operator` against the `O(N_q²)` double sum of the bracket's own definition, with the
physical gradient `∂ₓ = cos θ ∂_r − (sin θ/r) ∂_θ` written out by hand from the polar chart
rather than read off `PulledBack`. 32 basis functions, 288 quadrature nodes: agreement to
**9.4e-15**. The two controls are `O(1)` different operators against the same reference —
frame dropped **7.71e-01**, frame transposed **6.45e-01** — with the mobility composed with
the map in the frameless control so that the kernel weights are identical and the frame is the
only difference.

**On the `PolarSplineSpace` itself**, over the whole unit disk and through the pole, the same
hand-written reference gives **6.4e-15** at 35 basis functions and 288 quadrature nodes, against
**6.93e-01** with the frame dropped. That is a separate statement and not a repetition of the
annulus: the polar index set is not a product, the pairing is a sparse Cholesky rather than a
Kronecker mass, and the three pole functions reach around the entire angular axis. Symmetry,
semi-definiteness and the degeneracy hold there too, the last at **2.6e-16**.

**The unmapped path is unchanged**, which the existing suite guards: an identity-map pullback
reproduces the plain bracket to **7.6e-15**, and the mapped pairing it builds equals the
space's own mass matrix to **1.0e-17**.

**The routes agree on a mapped domain**: `metric_apply` against `metric_matrix * c` to
**5.1e-16**, `metric_directional` against the contracted `metric_derivative` tensor to
**7.9e-16**, and the analytic state derivative against a central difference of the assembled
bracket to **2.9e-09**.

New tests in `test/collisionbrackets_tests.jl` cover the annulus reference with both controls,
and an identity pullback reproducing the unmapped bracket; new tests in `test/pullback_tests.jl`
verify the frame is `J⁻ᵀ` and the volume element is `|det J|`. `scripts/verify_frame_covariance.jl`
is new and registered in `scripts/run_all.jl` with an index row in `docs/src/scripts.md`. Script
counts move from twenty-six to twenty-seven, file counts from thirty-four to thirty-five.

**Construction cost.** `PulledBack` factorises each node's Jacobian once and reuses it for both
solves — the metric's `J⁻¹𝔸J⁻ᵀ` and the frame `J⁻ᵀ` — where each solve previously factorised
afresh. Two factorisations per node rather than three: at 20 000 quadrature nodes, in fresh
processes at `--check-bounds=auto`, allocations fall from **34 131 968** to **30 291 968** bytes
and the best of twenty constructions from **30.55 ms** to **27.93 ms**, which is one 2×2 `lu`
per node. The frame this produces agrees with a per-solve refactorisation to at most **2 ulp**,
measured across the annulus, the disk through the pole and `r → 0`, because `lu(J)` and `lu(Jᵀ)`
pivot differently. The polar residuals above sit at that level and move with it; no other figure
in this entry does.

`metric_derivative` and `metric_directional` build the state's cross factors once and carry them
across the loop over the `N` basis directions, instead of rebuilding an operand that does not
depend on the direction.

`degeneracy_residual`'s `CollisionBracket` method is documented rather than commented, so the
manual records which `𝕄` it pairs against. The `⊥` convention names the three sites that form
it. The constructor's docstring states that `density` and a `PulledBack` are exclusive, and that
`CollisionBracket(space, Λ, pb; density = ρ)` is a `MethodError` rather than a silent choice
between two measures.

### Added — `PulledBack`, mapped domain pullback onto the parameter space

`PulledBack(space, F, DF; density, tensor)` carries a physical domain's measure and metric onto
the parameter domain a `DiscreteSpace` is built on, evaluated once at the quadrature nodes. New
exports: `PulledBack`, `measure`, `metric`, `jacobian_residual`.

**The mathematics.** A map `F` with Jacobian `J` sends an integral against `dμ = ρ(x) dx` to
one against `m = ρ(F)|det J|`, and a Dirichlet form against a physical coefficient `A` to one
against `𝔻 = m J⁻¹ A J⁻ᵀ`, because `∇_x = J⁻ᵀ ∇̂`:

    ∫_Ω f dμ                     =  ∫ (f∘F) m dx̂
    ∫_Ω (∇_x u)ᵀ A (∇_x v) dμ    =  ∫ (∇̂u)ᵀ 𝔻 (∇̂v) dx̂

The Jacobian `DF` is a required argument and is never differenced. `jacobian_residual(F, DF, x̂)` checks a supplied Jacobian against a central
difference of `F` — a test, not a fallback.

**Why one object rather than three call sites.** `measure(pb)` is the vector to hand a
`CollisionBracket` as its `density`; `metric(pb)` is the D×D matrix of per-node vectors that
`tensor_weighted_matrix` takes; `nodes(pb)` are the physical coordinates `F(x̂_q)`, where a
physical coefficient — a Grad-Shafranov mobility `M = Cr² + D` — must be sampled, not at the
parameter nodes. A mapped assembly needs the same weight in the bracket's measure, in the
weighted stiffness coefficient, and in any diagnostic that integrates over the domain. Supplying
it separately to each is how a factor lands in two of them and not the third, which is a wrong
answer rather than a failed assertion.

**Invariance.** `𝔻` inherits symmetry and positive semi-definiteness from the physical
coefficient `A`, because `J⁻¹AJ⁻ᵀ` is a congruence and `m ≥ 0`. So a metric bracket that goes
indefinite on a mapped domain has a coefficient problem, not a geometry problem.

**Measurements on an annulus**, all reproducible by `scripts/verify_pullback.jl`, on the polar
map `F(r,θ) = (r cos θ, r sin θ)` with `r ∈ [0.4, 1.3]`, cubic, 24×48 cells, where every
quantity has a closed form:

- Supplied Jacobian against a central difference: **2.5e-10**.
- Measure: `|det J| = r` pointwise to **4.4e-16**, and `∫ 1 dμ = 4.806636759992` against the
  exact `π(R₁²−R₀²)` at relative **0.0**.
- Metric: `𝔻 = diag(r, 1/r)` — the polar Laplacian's weak form — to **6.7e-16, 8.9e-16**, with
  off-diagonals below **3.9e-16**.
- Weak Laplacian `∫∇u·∇v dμ = −∫ v Δu dμ` for a `u` vanishing on both circles: relative
  **3.5e-9**.

**Convergence is nonvacuous.** Under refinement at 12, 24 and 48 radial cells the pullback's
relative residual is **2.5e-7, 3.5e-9, 5.4e-11**, while the plain parameter-square stiffness
stays at exactly 6.083e-02 and a version that keeps the measure but drops the metric stays at
exactly 9.829e-02 at every level — each converging to its own wrong operator. The dropped-metric
control is the error an area check cannot see, because the area never touches the metric.

**Physical density.** A density given in physical coordinates is composed with the map: `ρ =
1/|x|`, the Grad-Shafranov weight, pulled back onto the polar chart cancels `|det J| = r`
exactly and returns measure 1 to **4.4e-16**.

**The non-coordinate Grad-Shafranov disk map**, which has no closed-form metric: supplied
Jacobian against a central difference **2.9e-9**, and area 114.776878 against the 114.777 that
`Experiments/MetriplecticRelaxation/src/takeda.jl` obtains from its own P₁ triangulation,
relative **1.06e-6** — the difference being a deliberate `s = 1e-3` floor, since a
tensor-product space cannot carry the pole.

**Test coverage.** `test/pullback_tests.jl` is 24 tests. One worth naming: `jacobian_residual`
catches a **transposed** Jacobian, which leaves the determinant and therefore every area
untouched. `scripts/verify_pullback.jl` is registered in `scripts/run_all.jl` and indexed in
`docs/src/scripts.md`.

**Scope.** `PulledBack` needs no polar space and works on **any** `DiscreteSpace`, which is why
it is verified here on an annulus — the same coordinate map with the pole cut out, where a
tensor-product space suffices and every quantity has a closed form. The polar space that uses
it is the next entry.

### Added — `PolarSplineSpace`, a `DiscreteSpace` on a parameter square with a pole

`PolarSplineSpace` wraps SimpleSplines' `PolarSplineBasis`: a two-dimensional space on a
parameter square whose left radial edge is a **pole**, one point of the physical domain reached
from every angle, as on a mapped disk. It is `C⁰` and `C¹` there by construction, where a
tensor-product space is not even `C⁰` — the map collapses the whole circle `s = 0` to a point,
and nothing constrains a tensor-product basis's `θ`-dependence on it.

Constructed from a `PolarSplineQuadrature`, a `PolarSplineBasis`, a radial and angular basis
pair, or `PolarSplineSpace((ns, nθ), p)` for a cell count per axis and a degree. New exports:
`PolarSplineSpace`, and `pole`, `pole_triangle` and `pseudo_cartesian` forwarded from the basis.

**The interface is the same.** Every generic assembly of `spaces.jl` runs on it unchanged,
because the three things they are written against have the same shapes as on
`TensorSplineSpace`: `basis_values(s, d)` is a sparse `N × Q` table over the flattened
quadrature grid, `quadrature_weights(s)` is the matching flat vector, and
`mass_factorization(s)` answers `\`. It also answers `mixed_matrix`, `weighted_matrix`,
`derivative_matrix`, `stiffness_matrix`, `tensor_weighted_matrix`, `inverse_mass_matrix`,
`evaluate` and `field`, with per-axis derivative multi-indices throughout.

**Three things differ**, all consequences of a pole function reaching around the whole angular
axis. There is no `size(s)` and a coefficient vector is never reshaped, because the index set is
not a product. `mass_factorization` is a sparse Cholesky rather than a `KroneckerMass`. And
`inverse_mass_matrix` has no Kronecker shortcut and is a dense `N × N` solve.

**The space integrates against the parameter measure**, exactly as `TensorSplineSpace`
integrates against `dx`. A mapped domain's measure and metric are the map's and not the space's,
and come from `PulledBack`. That is what makes the two spaces mean the same thing by the same
method names.

### Changed — `CollisionBracket` takes any planar spline space

Its type constraint was `TensorSplineSpace{T, 2}`, which is stronger than the code: the bracket
asks only for `nbasis`, `quadrature_nodes` as a vector of pairs, `quadrature_weights`,
`basis_values(s, d::NTuple{2,Int})` and `field`. It is now
`PlanarSplineSpace{T} = Union{TensorSplineSpace{T, 2}, PolarSplineSpace{T}}` — a union rather
than an abstract type, because the two share no supertype below `DiscreteSpace` and
`DiscreteSpace` carries no dimension parameter to constrain. A third planar space joins by being
added to that union and needs no other change.

Nothing changed for an existing caller, and the whole suite passes unchanged.

**Measurements**, reproducible by `scripts/verify_polar_bracket.jl`, 24 checks:

- **The pulled-back Laplacian on the whole unit disk, pole included** — a question no
  tensor-product space can be asked. `u = 1 − s²` is radial, so it is in the polar space
  exactly (projection error 5.6e-15), it vanishes on the rim, and `∫|∇u|² dx = 2π` in closed
  form. Assembled at 32×64 cubic cells the relative error is **3.1e-14**, and the measure alone
  gives the disk's area `π` to 1e-12. The metric coefficient is `diag(s, 1/s)` and is singular
  at the pole: that is the true polar Laplacian, integrable because a `C¹` function has
  `∂_θu = O(s)`, and no quadrature node sits at `s = 0`.
- **A radial test field cannot detect a dropped angular metric.** With the metric dropped to
  `|det J|` times the identity, `u = 1 − s²` gives *exactly* the right answer, because
  `∂_θu = 0` and the `θθ` component never appears. The same control is 20 % wrong on a field
  with angular structure, which is why it is run on both. The plain parameter-square stiffness,
  with no pullback at all, is 33 % wrong.
- **The `CollisionBracket`'s structural properties survive the space change**, against the
  parameter measure and against `eq:mapping`'s `dμ = dr dz / r` alike: symmetry 3.5e-16,
  `λmin/λmax` −1.1e-17, degeneracy `(F,H)` 4.0e-17, against a wrong-generator control at 1.13.
  It is singular and not definite, as it must be.
- **Two controls that must break it.** A sign-changing mobility — `eq:M-condition` requires
  `M > 0` and nothing enforces it — drives `λmin/λmax` to −1.0. Replacing `z⊥ ⊗ z⊥` by `z ⊗ z`
  in an `O(Nq²)` reference keeps symmetry at 6.5e-17 and semidefiniteness at +5.1e-16 and
  breaks **only** the degeneracy, 1.5e-14 → 4.2e-01. That reference is first checked against
  the package's own collapsed form, or the control would establish nothing. Note that the
  control must be fed the *unperped* gradient: given the perped one, `z ⊗ z` reconstructs
  `z⊥ ⊗ z⊥` and cannot fail.
- **The recentring regime.** At generating-field spreads of 1e-3, 1e-5 and 1e-7 — a relaxed
  Grad-Shafranov state — the centred `𝔻_s` stays positive semi-definite, `λmin/λmax` at or
  above −3.2e-17, with the degeneracy at 3.5e-16.

`test/polarspaces_tests.jl` is 54 tests. `scripts/verify_polar_bracket.jl` is registered in
`scripts/run_all.jl` and indexed in `docs/src/scripts.md`, whose script counts move from
twenty-four to twenty-six.


### Fixed — the `[sources]` comments promised a retirement a version bump does not earn

**Comments only. No dependency, no bound and no resolved version changes.**

`scripts/Project.toml` and `docs/Project.toml` each ended their `[sources]` comment with "The
whole block can go once SimpleSplines is released". Both halves of that were wrong.
SimpleSplines' `0.1.0` is a `version` on `main`, not a registration — it is still absent from
General and carries no tags — so the promise reads as satisfied when it is not. And "the whole
block" also holds `PoissonBrackets = {path = ".."}`, which stays whatever happens to
SimpleSplines: this package is unregistered too, so deleting that line makes `docs/` and
`scripts/` resolve PoissonBrackets from a registry that does not have it. On Julia 1.10, where
`[sources]` is ignored, those two environments fail with `expected package PoissonBrackets to
be registered` — the package the comments had misnamed as SimpleSplines, which is what the root
environment reports instead.

Both comments now retire the SimpleSplines source specifically, say *registered* rather than
released, and quote the error their own environment produces. They also record that `rev =
"main"` pins once, into a gitignored `Manifest.toml`, so environments resolved at different
times sit on different commits of one branch: `Pkg.update("SimpleSplines")` refreshes such a
pin, while `Pkg.resolve()` treats it as fixed and reports `Unsatisfiable requirements`. The
root `Project.toml` — whose `[sources]` is the one that forces the `julia = "1.11"` floor —
carries the same note, which it previously lacked entirely.

### Changed — `scripts/check.jl` drops its two failure-list accessors

`failures` and `reset_failures!` are gone from the `Checks` harness, along with their entries in
its export list. The two were a matched pair for a runner that does not exist: something that
reads the tally between suites in one process and then clears it. `run_all.jl` is not that — it
gives every script its own subprocess, so each starts with an empty tally and nothing is ever read
back or reset.

**Neither had a caller in any of the three repositories that carry a copy of this file** — here,
`Experiments/MetriplecticRelaxation/scripts/` and
`Papers/Metriplectic Relaxation to Equilibria/scripts/` — by grep in all three, by
`trace_path(direction="inbound")` on the code graph in the two that are indexed, and by
inspection of all 60 `using .Checks: …` lines that import the harness: 31 here, 19 in
MetriplecticRelaxation, 10 in the paper, none anywhere else in the tree, and not one of them
naming either. An import list is the position a call-site count cannot see, and the one place an
unused export could still have been in real use. The removal is made in all three copies at once,
so they stay diffable.

`summary` remains the only read path for the tally, and `_failures` stays private with no
accessor — with a comment saying why, so the pair is not reinstated on the assumption that the
state was left unreachable by oversight. **No script's output changes:** the failure path still
records the label and still exits 1, checked with a deliberate failing check in each copy.

### Fixed — the SimpleSplines compat bound, after its 0.1.0 release

**Compat only. No code changed, and no computed result moves.**

SimpleSplines' `main` carried `version = "1.0.0-DEV"` while this package's `[compat]` bound was
`"1"`, which that pre-release satisfied. On 2026-09-07 SimpleSplines released `0.1.0` — a
*downgrade* in numbering rather than the `1.0.0` the bound anticipated — so the bound became
unsatisfiable and resolution fails outright with

```
ERROR: LoadError: empty intersection between SimpleSplines@0.1.0 and project compatibility 1
```

before a single test runs. The bound is now `"0.1"`.

This propagates immediately rather than at the next release, because `[sources]` resolves
SimpleSplines from `rev = "main"`: any downstream project that resolves *this* package from
`main` inherits the broken bound, which is how the failure first surfaced — in
`MetriplecticRelaxation`'s CI, in a pull request that does not touch `Project.toml`. The code
is effectively unaffected: eleven commits landed in SimpleSplines' `main` between this
package's last green suite run and the `0.1.0` release, three of them touching `src/`, but the
only executable change among them is a relocation of `_findcell` with a byte-identical body —
everything else is docstrings and comments. That release is a version on `main`, not a
registration — SimpleSplines is still absent from General — so the `[sources]` tables here, in
`docs/Project.toml` and in `scripts/Project.toml`, all stay. So does the `julia = "1.11"` floor,
which this package's own `[sources]` forces; the two environment tables are separate projects
and do not bear on it.

### Changed — the Julia floor is 1.11, which is what `[sources]` has always required

`[compat] julia` said `"1.10"`, and 1.10 never worked. `[sources]` is a Pkg 1.11 feature: on
1.10 the table is ignored, SimpleSplines is then an unregistered dependency, and resolution
fails outright with "expected package SimpleSplines to be registered". The declared floor was
unachievable rather than merely untested, so this is a correction to the declaration and not a
withdrawal of support that anyone had.

What it fixes is the CI matrix. `min` resolves the lower bound of this entry, so the three
`Julia min` jobs were installing 1.10 and failing in `julia-buildpkg` before reaching a single
test — on `main` exactly as on every branch. They now test 1.11, where the package resolves.
The check names do not move, because the matrix is written in aliases rather than version
numbers precisely so that a floor can be raised without renaming a required check.

Nothing in the package needs 1.11 specifically: there is no `VERSION` branch, no `@static`, and
no use of `ScopedValue`, `Memory` or the `public` keyword. Equally there is no 1.10 workaround
left to remove. The floor can go back down when SimpleSplines is registered and the `[sources]`
blocks in `Project.toml`, `docs/Project.toml` and `scripts/Project.toml` are deleted.

### Fixed — `scripts/` resolves `SimpleSolvers` from the registry

The local `SimpleSolvers = {path = "../../SimpleSolvers"}` source is gone from
`scripts/Project.toml`. It was added when 0.13 was unreleased and the only way to reach the
version the package requires was a sibling checkout; 0.13.2 is now in General, so the source
has nothing left to do and the package's own `Project.toml` already resolves it that way.

**A relative `path` source cannot work outside the main checkout**, which is what made this
worth removing rather than leaving inert. The path is resolved against the active project, so
from a worktree `../../SimpleSolvers` points beside the worktree rather than into `Packages/`,
and `scripts/` could not resolve at all — no manifest, so `run_all.jl` could not sweep. The
same arithmetic fails in CI, where the checkout has no sibling either. `scripts/Manifest.toml`
now resolves to `SimpleSolvers v0.13.2` from `registries = "General"`.

### Added — `MetriplecticFlow`, and `AbstractFlow` under both kinds of flow

The package could assemble a metric bracket and could not integrate one. `Integrator` and
every `residual!` in `integrators.jl` were typed on `HamiltonianFlow`, so a dissipative field
had nowhere to go. `AbstractFlow{T}` is now the root, `HamiltonianFlow <: AbstractFlow`, and

```
MetriplecticFlow(space, bracket, metric, hamiltonian, entropy)   # u̇ = P ∂H/∂û − 𝔾 ∂S/∂û
MetriplecticFlow(space, metric, hamiltonian, entropy)            # bracket = nothing
```

is the second flow, with the matching **analytic** Jacobian. The four-argument form is the one
the experiments run: the Poisson half is dropped and the field is purely dissipative.

**The `AbstractFlow` interface is three methods** — `space`, `vectorfield` and `jacobian` — and
the docstring says so. `Integrator` goes through `space(f)` rather than reaching into
`f.space`, so a flow that satisfies the documented interface is integrable in fact. `space` is
exported, because the one thing a downstream flow is *obliged* to define cannot be defined
without a name to define it on. Its declaration lives in `spaces.jl` rather than `flows.jl`:
two interfaces share the accessor and that is the file included before either of them, so the
declaration precedes its methods.

**Which conservation law comes from which half**, and they are independent. `H` is conserved
*exactly* — 2.1e-15 normalised over two meshes × three quadrature orders × twenty random
states — because `𝔾 ∂H/∂û = 0` is a property of the bracket, so no property of the quadrature
enters and nothing is asked of the integrator. `S` is monotone because `𝔾` is positive
semi-definite. The control is a bracket generated by the *wrong* field: still symmetric, still
semi-definite, and `Ḣ` is then **0.51**, so neither `issymmetric` nor `ispositive_semidefinite`
can catch what only the degeneracy sees.

**The sign convention makes `S` decrease.** With `𝔾` positive semi-definite, `+𝔾 ∂S/∂û` is a
backward heat equation; a quantity that is to increase along the flow is passed as its own
negative. `entropy_production(flow, û) = (∂S/∂û)ᵀ 𝔾 (∂S/∂û) ≥ 0` is `−Ṡ` when the Poisson half
is absent, and it is the quantity to assert a **sign** on while `S` is the one to assert
**monotonicity** on — a bracket with a sign error produces entropy the wrong way round, one
that has lost its degeneracy leaks `H`, and `|S − S₀|` reports both as "the quantity moved".

**`metric_directional(bracket, û, v)`** is the symmetric-half counterpart of
`bracket_directional`: the `O(N³)` tensor of `metric_derivative` already contracted against one
direction, which is all a Newton iteration ever needs. It agrees with the tensor contracted by
hand to **8.0e-16** for all four Λ-generated brackets. **The speedup is an order only for the
projector bracket** — 12× at `N = 25` rising to 147× at `N = 121`, because it is closed form
and assembles nothing. For the double and collision brackets the `N` perturbed assemblies
dominate the `N` sandwiches that contracting removes: **2.1× and 1.9× at `N = 121`**, and not
growing. Never slower is what survives, and it is the claim Newton depends on. The three
`metric_directional` docstrings state that qualitative claim and pin no digits: a wall-clock
ratio drifts between machines, so the numbers belong to the script that measures them.

**Newton must be iterated to a residual tolerance, not to a fixed iteration count.** `H` is
conserved because the *converged* midpoint increment lies in the range of `𝔾(ū)`, and with a
lagged Jacobian convergence is only linear, so the two are the same trade. Measured over 50
steps: the drift in `H` is 8.0e-16 at the default `f_abstol` of 2.0e-14 and stays there down to
1e-8, then jumps to **9.0e-7 at 1e-6** — nine orders, for a tolerance change of two.

Time discretisation behaves as the table in `IntegratorMethod` predicts. `ImplicitMidpoint` —
which for this field *is* Crank-Nicolson — holds `H` to **8.0e-16** relative over 200 steps,
`RungeKutta4` to **2.1e-11**, twenty-seven thousand times worse and still small; both drive `S`
down at every step, and the two agree to 5.3e-7 after 200 steps. No new solver code: the
existing `SimpleSolvers.NewtonSolver` does the nonlinear solve unchanged.

**`degeneracy_residual(flow, û)`** is the one to check on a `MetriplecticFlow`, and the
`MetriplecticFlow` docstring states the precondition. `𝔾 ∂H/∂û = 0` relates two arguments of
the constructor and nothing verifies that they match; a metric bracket generated by a
*different* Hamiltonian is still a perfectly good metric bracket, and the flow then loses `H`
at order one — 20 % over fifty implicit-midpoint steps in the one-dimensional projector
example, against 1.3e-16 for the matching pair. The two-argument
`degeneracy_residual(bracket, û)` cannot see it, because it takes the gradient from the
bracket and so reports a mismatched pair as clean. The flow method takes it from the flow.

**`poisson_defect` refuses a `MetriplecticFlow`** rather than dying inside `poisson_matrix`
with `MethodError: poisson_matrix(::Nothing, …)`. There are two reasons and the message says
which one applies: the four-argument form carries no `𝔓` at all, and where there is one the
metric half breaks the Poisson property *by construction*, so the number would measure the
dissipation rather than the method — which is worse than refusing, because it looks like an
answer. For a flow defined elsewhere it goes through the `bracket` accessor rather than
`f.bracket`, so such a flow reports the accessor it is missing instead of a bare `FieldError`
about a field the `AbstractFlow` interface never asks anyone to store.

**`stability_limit` does not claim an imaginary spectrum for every flow.** `2√2` is the
imaginary-axis crossing of the RK4 stability region and is the right constant for a
`HamiltonianFlow`, whose antisymmetric `𝔓` puts the spectrum on that axis. A `MetriplecticFlow`
has a negative real part by construction — that is what dissipation is — and the crossing on
the negative real axis is 2.7853. On a dissipative field the returned value is an order of
magnitude, not a threshold.

Two things that are easy to get wrong and are now recorded. The `Gonzalez` discrete-gradient
methods are **not** available for a metriplectic flow and are still typed on
`HamiltonianFlow` — they reach past `vectorfield` into the bracket and the Hamiltonian
separately, there is no such construction for a dissipative half, and a silent fallback that
integrated only the Poisson part would be worse than a `MethodError`. The `AbstractFlow`
docstring tabulates *when* each exclusion raises, which is what one needs when reading the
failure off a run: `formulation = :mixed` raises at the `Integrator` constructor, from
`mixed_jacobian_prototype`, while `Gonzalez` and `GonzalezMass` construct happily and raise at
the first `integrate_step!`, from inside the Newton callback. And `sin` is a poor
initial condition for the 1D example: it is an eigenfunction of `−∂ₓ²`, so `∂S/∂û` is parallel
to `∂H/∂û`, lands in the kernel of `𝔾`, and the whole vector field is 1e-13.

`scripts/verify_metriplectic_flow.jl` archives all of it, including the finding that `{S,H}`
vanishes on a uniform mesh — 4.8e-16, against 1.8e-2 on a graded one — because both quantities
are quadratic forms in commuting circulants there. That is the same circulance accident as the
KdV cross-conservation, and it is a statement about the mesh rather than an identity. It and
`verify_metric_collapse.jl` are registered in `scripts/run_all.jl`, which both `scripts.md`
and `verification.md` count, and each has an index row in `scripts.md` saying what it checks.

### Added — `CollisionBracket`, the §5.2 collision-like bracket, collapsed

`CollisionBracket(space, φ̂ | Λ; mobility, mobility_derivative, density)` is the third
`MetricBracket`, and the only one that is nonlocal:

```
(F,G) = ½ ∬ M(x,u) M(x',u') (∇f − ∇f')ᵀ Q₂(∇φ − ∇φ') (∇g − ∇g') dμ' dμ
```

Written that way one assembly costs `O(N_q²)` — some 10¹⁰ pair evaluations at 64² cells, which
is not affordable inside Newton. It collapses. In 2D `Q₂(z) = z^⊥ ⊗ z^⊥` exactly and perping is
linear, so with `β = (∇φ)^⊥` the kernel is quadratic in the inner point and the inner integral
is a fixed set of global moments, evaluated once. Because one fixed global quadrature rule
serves the inner sum at every outer point, the collapse is exact **at the quadrature level**,
so no discrete conservation property is perturbed — and that is measured rather than asserted:
the collapsed operator agrees with the `O(N_q²)` double sum to **7.0e-15** relative on the
periodic torus with `M = 1`, and to **2.6e-15** on the homogeneous-Dirichlet square with
`M(x,u) = ½ + u²` and the non-Lebesgue measure `dμ = dx/(1+x₁)`. The reference builds `Q₂` from
its definition `|z|²I − z ⊗ z`, so this tests the perp identity and the moment expansion
together rather than one rearrangement against another.

The bracket is symmetric to **4.7e-17**, has `min λ / max λ = −3.7e-17` — semi-definite and
genuinely singular, never definite — and `degeneracy_residual` is **3.3e-16**: `Q₂(z) z = 0`
holds at every *pair* of quadrature points, so `𝔾 ∂H/∂û = 0` is exact discretely.

**The moment count is 14 in `metric_apply` and eight `N`-vectors in the assembled operator**,
and the difference is worth stating because the plan predicted only the first. Fourteen scalars
— `m₀`(1), `q₁`(2), `Σ`(3), `n₀`(2), `B̃`(4), `T̃`(2) — suffice for the *pointwise* coefficients
`𝔻_s` and `𝔽_s`, which is what `metric_apply` evaluates in `O(N_q)`. An assembled matrix is not
a pointwise coefficient: the cross term `∬ κ ∇Φ_K(x)ᵀ Q₂ ∇Φ_L(x')` needs one `N`-vector per
separable factor, of which there are nine, from eight accumulators (`ℝ`, `𝕊`, `𝕋`, with `a`
derived as `tr 𝕋`). So the assembled operator is the local tensor-coefficient stiffness matrix
minus a **rank-nine** correction, independent of the mesh. The two routes are independent
implementations of the same operator, and they agree to **8.0e-16**.

**Recentring is a correctness requirement, not a refinement**, and the test asserts the
negative half. `Σ` is accumulated as `∫(β−β̄)⊗(β−β̄) M dμ'` directly; formed instead as
`M₂ − m₀ β̄⊗β̄` it is the same algebra and it fails. The testset sweeps the gradient spread over
six decades and asserts the **rate**: the centred form stays flat at round-off and
semi-definite at every node throughout, the uncentred one degrades monotonically until it has
no correct digits at all, and it is already wrong by three orders more than the centred form at
the loosest spread. The separation asserted is fifteen orders. At a spread of `1e-8` about a
mean of 3 the uncentred relative error is **0.21** against **1.2e-15** centred, and at `1e-10`
it reaches `1.8e+04`.

Whether the uncentred `𝔻_s` comes out *indefinite* at a given node is decided by summation
order, so it is a statement about a distribution and is measured where one can be, in
`verify_metric_collapse.jl`, which sweeps it over draws. A test that fixes one `ε` and one seed
asserts a rounding accident: a majority of forty seeded draws lose semi-definiteness under
`--check-bounds=auto` and **none of them** under `--check-bounds=yes`. Which of the two a run
gets is itself version-dependent — up to Julia 1.12 `Pkg.test()` forced `yes`, and from 1.13 it
runs the tests "with the same `check-bounds` setting as the current Julia session" — so the
`Julia 1` and `Julia min` jobs of one CI matrix need not agree.

The `q₁` terms are kept even though `q₁` vanishes at the centre: the bracket depends only on
differences `β(x) − β(x')`, so the origin is free, and it is that freedom which makes
`metric_derivative` analytic — the centre is frozen while `û` moves and `∂β̄/∂û` never appears.
Against a central difference at `ε = 1e-5` the analytic derivative is right to **2.9e-11**
relative, with both dependences live (`𝔾` is quadratic in `φ̂ = Λû` and bilinear in `M(x,u_h)`);
a prescribed `φ` with a state-independent mobility short-circuits to zeros without assembling.

Three controls that must fail, and do. Dropping the `⊥` and using `z ⊗ z` leaves a bracket that
is still symmetric and still positive semi-definite — a Gram matrix is a Gram matrix — and only
the degeneracy notices: residual **1.4**, against `1.1e-15`. The local half alone fails it the
same way, because `𝔻_s ∇φ(x) ≠ 0` — only the *difference* of gradients is annihilated — so it
is the nonlocal cross term that carries the degeneracy. And an `x`-**dependent** measure breaks
the collapse by **45%**, which is what "`dμ(x')` must not depend on `x`" actually forbids; the
Grad-Shafranov weight `dμ = dr dz / r` is harmless because it is absorbed into the quadrature
weights and never sees the outer point, which is why `density` is a field of the type rather
than an assumption.

The entropy enters only through `M`, fixed by `eq:M-condition` `M ∂²_y s = 1`: `s = ω²/2` gives
`M = 1`, `s = ω log ω` gives `M = ω`, and `s = y²/2(Cr²+D)` gives `M = Cr² + D`. The other half,
`∂_x∂_y s`, is the `G = S` case of `metric_apply` and belongs to the flow, not the bracket. For
§5.5 `M` is independent of `u` and `∂S/∂û` is linear, so the dissipative residual is an exact
**cubic** polynomial in the degrees of freedom — checked, not asserted: on the `(r,z)` rectangle
with `dμ = dr dz/r` the fourth difference is **1.5e-13** of the third and the third is constant
to **8.9e-14**, while the control that makes `M` depend on `u` gives 0.52. So the Jacobian there
is analytic and cheap and finite differences have no business being used for it.

A `mobility` given as a function must bring its derivative (`0` where `M` depends on `x` alone);
it is not differenced silently, for the same reason a general nonlinear generating field is
refused. It lives in `src/collisionbrackets.jl` rather than in `metricbrackets.jl`, which stays
about the hierarchy and the two local brackets.

### Added — `MetricBracket`, the symmetric half of a metriplectic structure

`DiscreteBracket` had no counterpart: the package could write down an antisymmetric bracket and
nothing dissipative, and `metriplectic_bracket` in `metriplectic.jl` acts on bare matrices and
never meets a discretisation. `MetricBracket{T}` is the mirror image of `DiscreteBracket` and
has the same three-method interface — `metric_matrix`, `metric_apply`, `metric_derivative` —
with everything else written once and generically. The two-argument `degeneracy_residual` is
the one convenience that costs more: it reaches the space and the generating field, so the
docstring names those two hooks as part of what a bracket must answer, and the reach goes
through `space(b)` rather than `b.space` so that a bracket missing it is refused by method name
instead of by `FieldError` about a field the interface never asked anyone to store.
`DoubleBracket`, `ProjectorBracket` and `CollisionBracket` answer all five.

What is derived once is `issymmetric` (an extension of `LinearAlgebra.issymmetric`, so
`using` both packages is unambiguous), `ispositive_semidefinite`, and `degeneracy_residual`.
`ispositive_semidefinite` is **relative to `λmax`**, and relative by multiplying the tolerance
by the scale rather than dividing by it: an absolute test would pass everything whose largest
eigenvalue is below one, and `1e-12 * Diagonal([1, -1])` is the case that catches it. A matrix
with no positive eigenvalue counts as semi-definite only if it is zero, which the multiplied
form already gives without a separate guard for `λmax ≤ 0`.

`degeneracy_residual` is the point. A metric bracket must satisfy `(A, H) = 0` for every `A`,
i.e. `𝔾 ∂H/∂û = 0`, and it is *that* which makes energy conservation a property of the bracket
rather than of the quadrature or the mesh. Whether a *one-step method* holds `H` exactly is a
separate question about the method: the midpoint rule does, because for a quadratic `H` the
identity `H(y) − H(x) = ∇H(ū)·(y − x)` is exact and the converged increment lies in the range
of `𝔾(ū)`; explicit methods do not. Both concrete brackets are generated by the Hamiltonian
and know their own `δH/δu`, so the two-argument form checks the defining property without
being told the Hamiltonian a second time. The residual is normalised the way `jacobi_residual`
is, by the largest single product entering the sum.

`DoubleBracket(space, h)` is §4.1, `(F,G) = ∫ [δF/δu, h]_J [δG/δu, h]_J dx` with
`h = δH/δu` — a variable-**tensor**-coefficient stiffness matrix, `tensor_weighted_matrix`
with `𝔻 = X_h ⊗ X_h` and `X_h = (∂₂h, −∂₁h)`, sandwiched between two inverse mass matrices.
The coefficient is written as the outer product rather than as
`Q₂(∇h) = |∇h|²I − ∇h ⊗ ∇h`, which in 2D is the same matrix exactly — the identity
`verify_metric_collapse.jl` checks over five decades of scale. The outer product is what makes
positivity manifest, and the `⊥` in it is what carries the degeneracy: `X_h · ∇h` vanishes
*pointwise*, so `𝔾 ∂H/∂û = 0` holds at the quadrature level and not merely in the continuum.

`ProjectorBracket(space, φ)` is §4.2, `(F,G) = (δF/δu, Π_H δG/δu)_{L²}`. It needs **no
quadrature at all**: the two inverse mass matrices of the discrete functional derivative
cancel against the `M` of the `L²` product and what is left is
`𝔾 = M⁻¹ − φ̂φ̂ᵀ/(φ̂ᵀMφ̂)`, a rank-one correction to the inverse mass matrix. `metric_apply` is
one mass solve and one inner product, independent of the mesh; positivity is Cauchy–Schwarz in
the `M`-inner product and the degeneracy is exact in exact arithmetic at any resolution. It is
dimension-agnostic — nothing in it is two-dimensional, unlike the double bracket, whose `⊥` has
no meaning on three axes and which therefore has no three-dimensional method rather than a
silently chosen plane.

Both take the generating field either as a **fixed coefficient vector** or as the **matrix `Λ`
of the linear map `ĥ = Λû`**. Those are exactly the manuscript's two-dimensional cases —
`h = cos²x₁ sin²x₂` prescribed for parallel diffusion, `ψ̂ = K⁻¹M ω̂` from the elliptic solve
for reduced Euler — and exactly the two for which `metric_derivative` is analytic. A general
nonlinear `h` is not accepted rather than being differenced silently.

`metric_apply` is a real override in both cases, not the fallback. For the double bracket it is
`∫ ∂ₖΦ_K X_k (X · ∇v_h)` at `O(NQ)`, against the `O(N²Q)` of assembling the operator and the
`O(N³)` of the sandwich. The sandwich itself goes through the mass *factorisation* column by
column — on a `TensorSplineSpace` that is `D` one-dimensional solves per column — rather than
through `inverse_mass_matrix`, whose `N²` storage `TensorSplineSpace` deliberately does not
cache.

The projector bracket's contraction goes through the mass **operator** for the same reason.
`metric_apply`, `project_orthogonal`, `metric_directional` and the two-argument
`degeneracy_residual` all need `𝕄 φ̂`; `mass_matrix` is a stored constant on a `SplineSpace` but
is rebuilt from the Kronecker factors on every call on a `TensorSplineSpace`, so reaching for
it would make the cost depend on the mesh after all. What `metric_apply` allocates on a
`TensorSplineSpace` is the vectors it returns and not a mass matrix per call: it grows linearly
in `N` — roughly 2.1 kB at `N = 25`, 4.0 kB at `N = 64` and 7.8 kB at `N = 144` for a
`ProjectorBracket` built from a **prescribed** generating field on the periodic torus, under
Julia 1.13 — where the matrix would have grown as `N²`. The docstring's claim that the cost is
independent of the mesh is true in fact and not only in algebra.

Measured, in `test/metricbrackets_tests.jl`, at `6 × 6` cubic cells on the torus (`N = 36`) and
`16` cubic cells on the line (`N = 16`):

- `DoubleBracket` with a prescribed variable `h`: asymmetry `5.0 × 10⁻¹⁴` against a scale of
  `88.8`, smallest eigenvalue `+1.4 × 10⁻¹⁵` against a largest of `1073`, degeneracy residual
  `8.0 × 10⁻¹⁶`, and `metric_apply` agreeing with `𝔾c` to `3.4 × 10⁻¹⁵` relative;
- `DoubleBracket` with `Λ = (K + ½M)⁻¹M`: asymmetry `4.4 × 10⁻¹⁶` relative, smallest eigenvalue
  `−3.1 × 10⁻¹⁵` against `243`, degeneracy `7.8 × 10⁻¹⁶`;
- `ProjectorBracket` with `φ = sin`: asymmetry `2.8 × 10⁻¹⁶`, smallest eigenvalue `−7.1 × 10⁻¹⁵`
  against `47.2`, degeneracy `6.0 × 10⁻¹⁶`, `Π_H φ = 0` **exactly** (`0.0`), and `Π² = Π` to
  `5.6 × 10⁻¹⁷`;
- `ProjectorBracket` with `Λ = K⁻¹M` on a homogeneous-Dirichlet `4 × 4` square: asymmetry
  `1.0 × 10⁻¹⁶`, smallest eigenvalue `+1.7 × 10⁻¹⁴` against `900`, degeneracy `2.0 × 10⁻¹⁶`.

`metric_derivative` against a central difference of `metric_matrix`, over every one of the `N`
directions: `1.2 × 10⁻¹⁰` relative for the double bracket at `ε = 10⁻⁴` and `2.0 × 10⁻¹⁰` for
the projector bracket at `ε = 10⁻⁵`. That is the floor of the *difference scheme*, not of the
derivative — the same tolerance rejects a derivative wrong by one per cent, which is the control
that makes the number mean something.

Four controls that must fail, and one that would have been vacuous:

- drop the `⊥` and build the coefficient from `∇h ⊗ ∇h`: still symmetric to `10⁻¹⁴` and still
  positive semi-definite — a Gram matrix is a Gram matrix — and the degeneracy residual goes to
  `1.88`. Only `degeneracy_residual` notices, which is why it exists;
- flip one diagonal component of `𝔻`: smallest eigenvalue `−0.289`. `X_h ⊗ X_h` cannot be
  indefinite, so this has to be broken by hand;
- project **onto** `φ` rather than onto its orthogonal complement: symmetric and positive
  semi-definite as before, degeneracy residual `8.0`;
- take the rank-one correction twice over: smallest eigenvalue `−2.68`;
- and the symmetry test uses a **variable** `h`. With a constant coefficient the two
  antisymmetries of `∫φ φ'` on a periodic axis cancel and the off-diagonal block comes out
  symmetric by accident — the same trap `TensorSplineSpace` recorded. The variable coefficient
  gives 37 % asymmetry where the claim is asymmetry, against `1.0 × 10⁻¹⁶` for `X_h ⊗ X_h`.

`CollisionBracket` (§5.2) is not here; it is the collapsed, recentred form and comes next.

### Added — `TensorSplineSpace`, a tensor-product `DiscreteSpace`

`DiscreteSpace` had two concrete spaces and both were one-dimensional and periodic, so every
equation in the package was one-dimensional too. `TensorSplineSpace{T,D}` is the box
`Ω₁ × … × Ω_D`, a thin wrapper over SimpleSplines' `TensorProductBasis` and
`TensorProductQuadrature` reached through the one dispatching constructor
`BSplineBasis(mesh, p, bc)` — so a periodic torus and a homogeneous-Dirichlet square differ by
one argument, and degree, mesh, domain and boundary condition are each per axis. Two and three
dimensions are the same code: `D` is a type parameter and nothing is written twice.

The abstract interface's promise that everything downstream is "a weighted contraction of those
tables … written once, generically" holds. `project`, `project!`, `basis_integrals` and `field`
are the generic implementations of `spaces.jl` running unchanged, because the tabulation is kept
as **one flat sparse `N × Q` Kronecker product** and the flattening — first axis fastest — is the
same convention as `LinearIndices` of the basis and as `kron(M_D, …, M_1)`. Coefficients stay
flat vectors, which is what the brackets, flows and integrators already take. The price is
storage: 26 MB per derivative multi-index at `64²` cubic cells, which buys a
`∫ f · Dᵃφ_k · Dᵇφ_l` with a **non-separable** `f` — something no sequence of one-dimensional
contractions gives.

What does not generalise is said so rather than papered over. `basis_values(space, d)` takes a
per-axis multi-index: `(1,0)` is `∂₁`, `(0,1)` is `∂₂`. A scalar `d ≥ 1` is **rejected**, with a
message naming the tuple — silently choosing an axis, or reading the scalar as a total order
that `(2,0)` and `(1,1)` both satisfy, would answer a question that was not asked. `d = 0` stays
meaningful, and that is what keeps the generic assemblies above working. `derivative_matrix`
takes the axis it differentiates along, `stiffness_matrix` is `∫ ∇Φ_K · ∇Φ_L`, and
`domainlength` returns the **per-axis tuple**; the scalar that does exist is the new
`domainvolume`.

`tensor_weighted_matrix(space, 𝔻)` is what the metric brackets need: `∫ ∂ₖΦ_K 𝔻ₖₗ(x) ∂ₗΦ_L dx`
summed over `k, l`, assembled as `D²` scalar-weighted matrices. `𝔻` may be a constant matrix,
per-component sample vectors, one matrix per quadrature point, or a function of the point. It is
symmetric exactly when `𝔻` is, and positive semi-definite when `𝔻` is pointwise so; neither is
imposed, both are checked.

The mass solve goes through SimpleSplines' `KroneckerMass` — `D` one-dimensional solves along
each axis, no `N × N` factorisation. `inverse_mass_matrix` exists because the generic assemblies
name it, but it is **rebuilt on every call and not stored**: the Kronecker identity makes the
arithmetic cheap and the `N²` storage is not (161 MB at `N = 67²`, growing as the fourth power of
the resolution), so the docstring says outright that it is the wrong thing to call in a loop.
`SplineSpace` forms it eagerly because at `N = 384` that is free; here it is not.

Measured, in `test/tensorspaces_tests.jl`:

- the mass matrix sums to `|Ω|` on the periodic torus **exactly** at `8 × 12` cells, and the
  flattened `Φ diag(w) Φᵀ` and the Kronecker mass agree to `7 × 10⁻¹⁷` — which is the
  first-axis-fastest convention being right rather than nearly right;
- `L²` projection reproduces `x³y³` on a clamped cubic basis to `1.6 × 10⁻¹⁶`, and `x⁴` not at
  all (`2.3 × 10⁻⁵`), so the first number measures exactness and not a fortunate mesh;
- projection of `sin x₁ cos 2x₂` on the torus converges at order **3.82** between 16 and 32
  cells — `O(h^{p+1})`, not spectral, which is the deliberate deviation from the paper's Fourier
  method showing up where it should;
- the generalised eigenvalues of stiffness against mass on the `12 × 12` cubic torus match
  `k₁² + k₂²` to `7.1 × 10⁻⁵` over the lowest 25 modes and to `0.60` at the top of the spectrum
  — the second number is what makes the first a statement about the *resolved* modes;
- the lowest Dirichlet eigenvalue on the unit square is `2π²` to `1.3 × 10⁻⁷`, i.e. `19.739211`
  against `19.739209` — the §5.4 reference `λ₁,₁ = 2π²`, reached here by the space alone;
- `tensor_weighted_matrix` with `𝔻 = I` is the stiffness matrix bit for bit (`0.0`), and with
  `diag(1,0)` the `∂₁` block bit for bit, through all four coefficient forms.

Three controls that can fail, and one that would have been vacuous:

- an anisotropic `𝔻 = diag(2,1)` moves the matrix by 50 % of its scale, and by *exactly* the
  extra `∂₁` block;
- a pointwise-indefinite `𝔻` breaks positivity — lowest eigenvalue `−1.27` against `−2.3 × 10⁻¹⁵`
  for the PSD one;
- the asymmetry control has to use a **variable** coefficient. With a constant off-diagonal `𝔻`
  the two antisymmetries of `∫φ φ'` on a periodic axis cancel and `∫∂₁Φ_K ∂₂Φ_L` comes out
  symmetric to `2 × 10⁻¹⁶` by accident; the variable coefficient gives 27 % asymmetry. Written
  the obvious way this check proves nothing.

Three dimensions are exercised too, at `4³`: same accessors, same assembly, `𝔻 = I` reproducing
the stiffness matrix bit for bit.

### Added — `verify_metric_collapse.jl`

Whether the collision-like metric bracket of §5.2 can be evaluated in `O(N_q)` instead of the
`O(N_q²)` its definition asks for. It can, exactly, and the script settles the count: **14 global
moments**, 6 for `𝔻_s` (`m₀`, `p₁`, symmetric `M₂`) and 8 for `𝔽_s` (`n₀`, `B`, `T`). This decides
whether the bracket is affordable inside Newton at all — naively it is ~3·10¹¹ flops per residual
at 64² cells — so it is verified before anything is built on it, and it uses only the standard
library, no grid and no basis.

The mechanism is that `Q₂(z) = |z|²I − z⊗z` equals `z^⊥ ⊗ z^⊥` exactly in 2D, so the inner
integrand is a quadratic in `∇φ(x')^⊥` and integrates to moments. Sufficiency and minimality are
both measured rather than argued: every moment is a *linear* functional of the node weights, so
perturbing the node data along the null space of the moment map must move neither coefficient —
it moves them by `2.5 × 10⁻¹⁵` — while the `(moments → 𝔻_s, 𝔽_s)` Jacobian has full rank 14,
`σ₁₄/σ₁ = 0.165`. The two apparent extra accumulators are redundant: `m₂ = tr M₂` and `c₁ = tr B`,
and expanding `Q₂` from its definition rather than through the perp identity produces ten `𝔽_s`
accumulators of which `n₂` and `T` enter only as `n₂ − T`.

**Recentring on the `M`-weighted mean is a correctness requirement, not a refinement**, and the
script measures the failure it prevents. Where `∇ψ` has a large mean and small spread — a plausible
relaxed Grad–Shafranov state — the raw moment form computes `𝔻_s` as a difference of large terms.
Over 200 draws per spread its relative error passes 1 at a spread of `10⁻⁷` and reaches `6 × 10⁶`
at `10⁻¹⁰`, and it returns a `𝔻_s` that is **not positive semi-definite** in 45/200 draws at `10⁻⁷`,
rising to 180/200. That flips the sign of the entropy production: a structure violation, not an
accuracy loss. The centred form is a sum of two Gram terms, hence PSD by construction — 0 failures
in 1800 draws — and its error degrades to `6 × 10⁻⁵` rather than catastrophically.

Three controls, because a check that cannot fail proves nothing:

- **The index convention.** `(b⊗w)_ij = b_i w_j` is load-bearing. Swapping `B` for its transpose
  in the one term that distinguishes them gives a median relative error of `0.19`, above `0.1` at
  97.5 % of outer points. It is reported as a spread and not a worst case on purpose: the
  difference is exactly `(B − Bᵀ)δ`, so it *shrinks with* `δ` and is genuinely small at an outer
  point near `β̄` — a control keyed to the minimum would fail for a reason unrelated to the
  convention.
- **The polynomial hypothesis.** The same null-space perturbation that leaves the quadratic kernel
  invariant to `2 × 10⁻¹⁵` moves the true Landau kernel `|z|⁻³Q₂(z)` by `0.24`. The hypothesis is
  real, not decorative, which is the sense in which §6's cost claim holds for Landau and not for
  §5.2's own choice.
- **The measure.** Grad–Shafranov's `dμ = dr dz / r` is `x`-independent, so it folds into the
  quadrature weights and the collapse stays exact to `6 × 10⁻¹⁵` on `[1,7] × [−9.5,9.5]`. An
  `x`-*dependent* measure breaks it by `0.99`, which is what "`dμ(x')` must not depend on `x`"
  actually forbids.

Registered in `scripts/run_all.jl`. No source changes and no new dependencies.

### Fixed — section 7 measured its denominator bound on too small a set

`verify_kdv_nambu.jl`'s steps (2) and (3) pin the second and third slot modes — `b + c = 0`, then
`c = 0` — but nothing pins the first: step (1) forces `p = −a` for every `a` in range, `a = 0`
included. The check that the symbol's denominator stays away from zero *off* the Casimir column
filtered `a ≠ 0` all the same, and so reported a floor of `2.0` over a strictly smaller set than
the contraction reaches. Over the right set the floor is `1.0`, attained at `(a,b,c) = (0,1,−1)`,
where `e₂ = −1` and `e₃ = 0`. The statement of that bound in the section below is corrected with it.

Nothing the section establishes moves — off the Casimir column the denominator is bounded away from
zero, which is the whole content of the check, and that was never in doubt either way. What was
wrong was the number printed beside it, which claimed a margin twice what the argument supports.
The check now *asserts* that floor instead of printing it beside a weaker `off > 0`, so a bound
that drifts from the set it was measured on fails loudly rather than silently; on `b = −c` the
denominator is `c⁴(1 + a²)`, so `1.0` is the floor for every `K ≥ 1` and not an artefact of the
script's `K = 3`. The generator carries the reason `a` is unconstrained, so the filter is not
reinstated as a tidy-up.

### Fixed — the Julia/Python agreement table read as a live claim

`verification.md`'s row for `verify_kdv_nambu` recorded `48 PASS / 0 FAIL both` while the script
had already grown to 76, so the documentation contradicted the entry above that reports the growth.
The count was never wrong — every row in that table is frozen at the moment of conversion, which is
the only moment at which a Python original existed to compare against — but nothing in the row said
so, and a reader running the script today gets a different number. The row now marks the count as
*at conversion* and names section 7 as postdating the retirement of the prototypes. Only the row
that contradicted this file was corrected; the other seventeen were not re-audited against their
scripts' current counts, so the same drift may be present in them.

### Tracks the reshaped SimpleSplines

The package is now built and tested against SimpleSplines `c74e37d`, which replaced the
periodic-only package with three bases, arbitrary homogeneous boundary conditions, and tensor
products of any number of them. **Nothing here changes.** The suite passes unaltered and no
number moved.

That is worth recording rather than assuming, because the dependency's own notes list three
breaking changes, and none of the three is reachable from here:

| the change there | why it is invisible here |
|:--|:--|
| `Mesh` partitions a closed interval, not a periodic one | `SplineSpace` hands the mesh straight to `PeriodicBSplineBasis`, whose dimension is still `N = n` |
| `breakpoints` returns `n+1` points instead of `n` | called nowhere in this package; `SplineQuadrature` absorbs it |
| `cellbounds` is gone | called nowhere in this package |

`UniformMesh(n, L)`, `GradedMesh(n, L)` and `RandomMesh(n, L)` still accept a bare `L` meaning
``[0, L]`` and still produce the same breakpoints, so every call site in `src/`, `test/` and
`scripts/` stands unedited — including the non-2π `UniformMesh(64, 40.0)` of the soliton tests.

One thing did change, and correcting it touched a comment, a docstring and the discretisation
page: `mass_operator` now dispatches on the **basis** rather than on the mesh. A uniform mesh is
necessary for circulance but not sufficient, since a clamped basis has `p` boundary functions at
each end that are not translates of anything. `LagrangeSpace` still builds its `FactorizedMass`
by hand, and now for a second reason as well — there is no SimpleSplines basis to dispatch on.

The two reasons it *documented* for not using the alternatives were stale, and are now measured
rather than asserted. `CirculantMass` does not require one degree of freedom per cell:
`CirculantMass(M, n)` takes `n` as a free argument, and the `ncells` constraint lived in the
`mass_operator(M, ::UniformMesh)` that `c74e37d` deleted. What actually rules it out is that a
nodal mass matrix is block-circulant in `p × p` blocks for `p > 1`, the nodes within an element
not being translates of one another. And `BandedMass` does not refuse the periodic seam — it
reads its half-bandwidth off the stored entries, finds `N - 1` because of the wrap's corner
entries, and factorises a dense matrix while calling it banded. The conclusion both texts drew,
that the Fourier path is available only at `p == 1`, was correct throughout; only the reasons
were wrong.

`[compat]` is unchanged at `SimpleSplines = "1"`. The package is still unregistered and still
`1.0.0-DEV`, so the `[sources]` entries and the comments explaining them stay as they are.

### Added — Nambu's Liouville criterion, as section 7 of `verify_kdv_nambu.jl`

Nambu's guiding principle in 1973 was neither the Jacobi identity nor the fundamental identity
of 1994 but **Liouville's theorem**: his eq. (3) is `div(∇H × ∇G) = 0`, and both slot functions
being conserved is a *consequence* of antisymmetry rather than the design goal. The script
reported a Jacobi residual and a Poisson-map residual and never asked his question. It does now,
in twenty-eight checks, taking the script from 48 to 76.

**The structural half is a two-line cancellation.** For `u̇_i = Σ_jk S_ijk a_j b_k`,

```
div = Σ_ijk [ (∂S_ijk/∂û_i) a_j b_k  +  S_ijk F_ij b_k  +  S_ijk a_j G_ik ]
```

and the last two terms die on the spot: `S` is antisymmetric in `(i,j)` where the Hessian `F_ij`
is symmetric, and antisymmetric in `(i,k)` where `G_ik` is. **So a constant totally
antisymmetric `S` is divergence-free for any pair of slot functions whatever**, and that is the
whole of the wedge tensor's Liouville property — `𝖯¹` is a constant matrix, measured at
`4.8 × 10⁻⁸` on a uniform mesh and `6.0 × 10⁻⁹` on an arbitrary one. Recorded as an instance of
the lemma, not as evidence about Nambu brackets: nothing else could have happened.

**The interesting case is `{u, H₂, C₀}`, and the answer is not the one the shape suggests.**
There `S` genuinely depends on `u`, so the first term survives — and the flow is divergence-free
anyway, at `2.2 × 10⁻¹⁰` against a flow of size `38.9`. It is *not* the lemma in disguise: the
trace `Σ_i ∂S_ijk/∂û_i` is a nonzero matrix, `max |trace| = 4.99` at a tensor scale of `2.86`.
**What vanishes is its Casimir column alone** — the column belonging to the constant function in
the third slot — exactly, while every other column reaches `4.99`. Put `ψ₂`, `ψ₃` or `ψ₄` there
instead and the divergence is `−0.50`, `+1.17`, `+0.67`. So Liouville here is a property of the
*pair of slot functions*, not of the bracket.

It survives every variation tried: truncations `K = 2, 3, 4, 5`, and both of the uniform weights
`g ≡ 2i` and `g ≡ 3i` that section 5 shows are *inconsistent* with KdV. So it is the whole
one-function family of section 5 that has a vanishing Casimir column, not the particular
solution, and the zero-mode anomaly has nothing to do with it.

**And the mechanism is identified, in three steps that never look at the weight.** Writing
`∂S_ijk/∂û_m` out over modes as `2π Σ_{p+a+b+c=0} σ(p,a,b,c) (B_m)_p (B_i)_a (B_j)_b (B_k)_c`:

1. the real basis is closed under conjugation, so `Σ_i (B_i)_p (B_i)_a = δ_{p,−a}/2π` — measured
   at a defect of `2.8 × 10⁻¹⁷` — and contracting the field index against the first slot forces
   `p = −a`;
2. the mode constraint `p + a + b + c = 0` then leaves `b + c = 0`;
3. the Casimir column is `c = 0`, hence `b = 0`: the surviving triples are `(a,0,0)`, with the
   second and third slot modes **coincident**. All seven are zero, while off that column the
   symbol's denominator is bounded below by `1.0`.

That last step kills them three independent times, which is what makes the result robust rather
than a consequence of a convention: total antisymmetry gives `S_{i11} = 0` outright, the constant
basis function standing in both remaining slots; the Vandermonde numerator `V(a,0,0)` vanishes,
`V` vanishing whenever two arguments agree; and only then does the denominator `e₂² + e₃²` vanish
with it, leaving `make_sigma`'s guard to resolve a `0/0`. So no regularisation of the symbol off
the `e₃ = 0` slice can reach the triples the contraction selects. It is also the **same zero-mode
coincidence** that forces the bracket's anomaly, where the weight at the mean of `u` must be `3/2`
of its value elsewhere — one phenomenon, two places.

That has a consequence for how the earlier evidence should be read: **the weight sweep could not
have failed.** `g` enters none of the three steps, so the two uniform weights are closer to the
labelled trap than to a control, and the section now says so where it previously claimed the
mechanism was unidentified. The prediction the argument makes is stronger than the sweep tested,
and it holds — weights `0 / i`, `2.5i / −7.3i` and `−7.3+0.5i / 11.1−4i`, none of which solves
anything, all give a Casimir column of exactly zero against other columns reaching `1.06`, `7.30`
and `3.77`. Step 1 is load-bearing: repeat the contraction in the complex-exponential basis,
which is orthonormal but *not* closed under conjugation, and the constant-mode column is `0.95`
against a matrix maximum of `2.87`.

Two things make the checks non-vacuous, in the spirit of the `se(3)` control above.

- A **negative control**: the same construction with a field-dependent antisymmetric `S` gives
  `div = 2.454` against a flow of `9.050`, so antisymmetry alone does not buy Liouville.
- The **trap**, and it is the one that would have been walked into. If the field index is
  antisymmetric against the first slot as well — a tensor antisymmetric in all four indices —
  then `Σ_i T_iijk` vanishes identically and the control cannot fail. Measured at exactly zero
  over a tensor of scale `0.78`. The control therefore uses a `T` antisymmetric in the three
  slots only.

`{u, H₂, C₀}` is built on an **orthonormal** real trigonometric basis, so the Gram matrix is the
identity and `∂F/∂û_j` is the coefficient vector of `δF/δu` with no mass matrix anywhere. That
construction is validated rather than assumed: it reproduces the KdV right-hand side to
`7.1 × 10⁻¹⁵` against `|rhs| = 38.9`, which is section 5's result recomputed through the new
representation. Divergences are measured by central differences on the flow itself, and the
closed form agrees with them. Every flow in the section is a polynomial of degree at most two,
so that difference has no truncation error at all and `h` trades against cancellation alone —
the measured `2.2 × 10⁻¹⁰` is one ULP of `|flow|` over `2h`, a factor of 1750 below the
threshold, and a *larger* `h` would be better. `divergence_fd` now says so, because the
generosity of its default does not survive being copied to a nonlinear flow.

No new exports and no new dependencies.

### Added — `verify_zeitlin_three_bracket.jl`

Whether the Bialynicki-Birula--Morrison three-bracket `[A, B, S] = {A, B}` reproduces the Zeitlin
bracket on `su(N)`. It does, at `N = 3, 5`, to `2 × 10⁻¹⁵`.

The question is not routine, which is why the script exists rather than a remark. Salmon (2005)
§5 reports that this mechanism fails for the two-dimensional vorticity bracket, the continuum
algebra carrying no non-degenerate invariant form and hence no quadratic Killing Casimir.
**The sine-bracket truncation supplies exactly that**: the Killing form of `sine_algebra(N)` is
non-degenerate, and `κ^{mn} ∝ δ_{m+n,0}` to `2 × 10⁻¹⁵`, so Zeitlin's `I₂ = Σ_k ω_k ω_{-k}` *is*
the Killing Casimir rather than merely something of the same shape. The mechanism fails before
truncation and works after it.

**What semi-simplicity buys is non-degeneracy of `κ`, and nothing else here.** The lowered
structure constants `c_ijk = c_ij^m κ_mk` are totally antisymmetric for *every* Lie algebra, by
ad-invariance of the Killing form; the script measures a `(j,k)` defect of exactly zero on
`se(3)` and on `so(3)` with abelian directions, both of which have a singular `κ`. That check is
kept as a verification of the index conventions, not as evidence for the hypothesis.

Two negative controls, and they are half the point of the script:

- `I₃`, the cubic invariant, in the third slot gives `1.019` relative deviation after optimal
  rescaling — the quadratic hypothesis is load-bearing, and the reason is checked directly as a
  homogeneity mismatch, degree 1 against degree 2 in `ω`.
- **`se(3)`**, where `κ` is singular *and* its degenerate directions are non-central, so even
  `pinv(κ)` — the most generous repair available — recovers nothing: `max|B3 - J| = 2.175`
  against `max|J| = 2.175`. `so3(Float64, n)` for `n > 3` is run alongside it and is a **false**
  control: `κ` is singular there too, but the degenerate directions are central, `J` vanishes on
  them anyway, and `pinv` recovers the bracket exactly. Same trap the `so3` docstring already
  warns about for Jacobi checks, in a second guise — a control that fails for a reason that does
  not generalise is no better than one that cannot fail.

Everything is computed from the structure constants alone — the Killing form as
`κ_mn = Σ_ij c_mi^j c_nj^i` — so nothing depends on the matrix realisation `sine_algebra`
happens to use. No new exports and no new dependencies; the script uses `sine_algebra`,
`lie_poisson_matrix`, `lie_poisson_derivative`, `jacobi_residual`, `so3` and `se3` as they stand.

### Fixed — checks in the fable scripts that could not fail

Review of the seven scripts turned up assertions that were true by construction rather than by
computation, so a broken pipeline would have reported a pass.

- `I1_vlasov_uN.jl` §4c asserted `tr((1/iℏ)[X,P] − I) = −N`. The trace of a commutator vanishes for
  any pair of square matrices, so that held whatever `X` and `P` were. It now measures the inner
  block `m,n ≤ N/2` instead: the CCR defect is non-zero there at every `N` and decays only as
  `1/N` — 5.4e−2 to 1.4e−2 from `N = 8` to `32`, a ratio of 3.78 against the 4 that `1/N` predicts
  — which is the algebraic tail a symbol that is not band-limited leaves behind. A defect
  genuinely confined to the wall would be invisible at that depth. §4d printed two conclusions,
  that a zero-field-compatible potential does not leak and that a kink does, and asserted neither;
  both are now checks.
- `III4_multifield_derivative.jl` computed the largest cyclic term as its non-vacuity witness,
  printed it, and then left it out of the verdict — so every vanishing verdict in the file rested
  on nothing. It now enters all of them. Six comparisons of the general obstruction against the
  Jacobiator were skipped by an unexplained `continue`; they are re-enabled and pass. Three
  Jacobiators were computed twice, once printed and once checked; they are computed once.
- `III1_structure_function_4d.jl` §4b is the only code exercising the two-dimensional
  floating-point path, and its one check passed on `0.0` whether or not a single term had been
  formed. It gained the witness and a negative control — `c = f ∂_x f`, because `c = φ(z) f` is
  Poisson in two dimensions and is a control only in four.
- `II1_semidirect_flat.jl` compared the ρ-row of the push-forward against itself; it is now built
  through the chart. The symbol of the entropy bracket is read off `J3` rather than retyped, and
  `S` is verified to be the Galerkin derivative against two integrands the element space
  represents exactly — the identity the four interval-form checks silently assumed.
- `III2_refutation.jl`'s three-route agreement would have passed had all three routes returned
  zero, and its log-mean bound was relative to a quantity of size 176, i.e. 1.8e−7 absolute
  against a residual of 1.4e−12. `III2_matrix_structure_function.jl` printed the finite-difference
  noise floor that calibrates its own threshold without ever asserting it.

Also corrected: `θ_ctrl` in `III2_matrix_structure_function.jl` is `(a−b)(1 + a² + ab + b²)`, not
the `(a−b)(a² + b²)` its label claimed in two result tables; the degree-3 Wigner coefficient in
`I1_vlasov_uN.jl`'s header is `+(ℏ²/4)`, as the code has always computed; and `cosk`/`sink` in
`fabletools.jl` built their `Dict` from a literal, so at `k = 0` the two keys coincided and `cosk`
returned half its amplitude — real, and therefore silent. No current consumer uses a zero
wavevector.

Check counts move with the changes: I.1 89 → 91, II.1 147 → 144, III.1 58 → 61,
III.1-refutation 99 → 98, III.2 114 → 115, III.2-refutation 118 → 121, III.4 77 → 87.

### Added — a driver for the fable scripts

`scripts/run_fable.sh` runs the seven `scripts/fable/` scripts, each in its own process, and exits
nonzero if any check fails. They get a driver of their own rather than a place in `run_all.jl`
because `fable/III4_multifield_derivative.jl` alone takes about eleven minutes, longer than all of
`run_all.jl` together; folding them in would turn a two-minute driver into a fifteen-minute one and
change what it is for. `run_all.jl` and `docs/src/scripts.md` both record the exclusion and its
reason, and the seven have index rows in the latter.

Without it the seven were registered nowhere, and `run_all.jl`'s own "Run every verification
script" had quietly become false.

### Added — an adversarial re-check of the structure-function bracket

`scripts/fable/III1_refutation.jl` attacks the same statement as
`scripts/fable/III1_structure_function_4d.jl` — that `{A,B}_c = ∫ c(f){A_f,B_f} μ` is Poisson for
every smooth `c` — from an independent implementation that shares no code with it or with
`fabletools.jl`, so that a defect in the shared machinery cannot hide in both. It computes the
Jacobiator by carrying each field's first variation as a linear differential operator and
integrating that operator by parts, rather than by directional derivatives and cyclicity, and
compares the result against a closed form derived separately. 98 checks, exact over `ℚ(i)`.

The statement survives, in dimensions 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8, for degenerate bivectors and on an
odd-dimensional torus with no symplectic form at all. Two things it establishes that the earlier
script does not: the identity `Q μ = α∧β∧γ∧δ∧ω^{n−2}/(n−2)!` holds with sign `+1` **only** against
the Liouville form, since `ω^n/n!` and `dx_1∧…∧dv_n` differ by `(−1)^{n(n−1)/2}`; and the Jacobiator
is non-zero — `−127697733/64` — as soon as the volume form is not Liouville, so that hypothesis is
load-bearing rather than decorative. Every vanishing verdict is guarded by an assertion that the
integrand could have been non-zero, after three separate accidental zeros during development.

### Added — an adversarial re-check of the matrix structure-function bracket

`scripts/fable/III2_refutation.jl` attacks the same two statements as
`scripts/fable/III2_matrix_structure_function.jl` — that `tr(c(W)[F_W,G_W])` on `gl(N)*`/`u(N)*` is
Poisson iff `c` is affine, and the spectral-kernel classification behind the pushforward family —
from an implementation that shares no Jacobiator code with it. 121 checks, exact over `ℚ`.

The point of the script is one step that no closed form can cross-check. A spectral-kernel bracket
is defined through the eigendecomposition of `V`, so its Jacobiator needs the derivative of the
**eigenvectors**; the classification theorem rests entirely on that step. Here the gradient is
instead built by brute force from first-order perturbation theory at a diagonal `V` with distinct
rational eigenvalues, which is rational in the entries, and the theorem's closed form is then a
prediction compared against it. The perturbation machinery is itself validated first against a route
that never mentions an eigenvector — the polynomial Fréchet derivative
`Dc_W(E) = Σ_k a_k Σ_{i+j=k−1} W^i E W^j` — which agrees with it exactly.

Both statements survive. The closed form matches brute force on all twenty kernel/dimension pairs
tried, including three kernels that are neither `c`-brackets nor pushforwards, where the two special
families give no cross-check at all; five pushforwards give exactly zero and five non-pushforwards
exactly non-zero. `N = 2` is confirmed to vanish for every `c`, and the script's own derivation shows
why without Cayley–Hamilton: the obstruction needs three *distinct* eigenvalue indices, so `N = 2` is
not a weak control but no control. The log-mean bracket is Poisson to `8e-15` relative through the
same code path that returns an exact `176` for `c = v²`, and the two kernels are shown to separate at
`O(gap²)`, which is the reported `N⁻²` rate.

One thing the script records that the earlier one does not: `c' > 0` restricts `c = v²` to `v > 0`,
the flat coordinate `ψ = ½ln v` does not cross zero, and the log-mean kernel `2(a−b)/log(a/b)` is
real only when `a` and `b` share a sign. The pushforward representative of the enstrophy bracket
therefore exists on definite spectra only — which a Zeitlin truncation of 2-D Euler vorticity is not.

### Added — shared verification machinery for the fable branch

`scripts/fable/fabletools.jl` provides exact-arithmetic machinery for the fable verification
suite: trigonometric polynomials over `ℚ(i)` on an arbitrary-dimensional torus T^D, first-order
jets for computing Gateaux derivatives, and the canonical Poisson bracket on T^{2n}. Plain
definitions in a shared include file, so scripts extending the machinery to their own field types
(as III.1 does for floating-point spectral grids) do so without module boundaries. Used by
`III1_structure_function_4d.jl` and `III4_multifield_derivative.jl`.

### Added — Vlasov–Poisson on a bounded domain as Lie-Poisson on `u(N)*`

`scripts/fable/I1_vlasov_uN.jl` quantises the Vlasov–Poisson system on a bounded spatial domain
over the space of density matrices ρ on u(N)*, using compressed Weyl quantisation. The Lie-Poisson
bracket `{F,G}(ρ) = (1/iℏ) tr(ρ [F_ρ, G_ρ])` is the underlying structure. The main theorem: for
symbols of degree ≤ 1 in momentum on the inner block (away from boundaries), the homomorphism
defect `D(a,b) = (1/iℏ)[T_N a, T_N b] − T_N{a,b}` vanishes exactly, and for degree 2 it equals the
Wigner-equation correction with its exact coefficient `(ℏ²/24) φ''' ∂_p³`. 91 checks, including
exact arithmetic on gl(N,ℚ) for N=3,4,5, Casimirs and continuity in dimensions and boundary
conditions (periodic S¹ and Dirichlet [0,π]), and floating-point refinement studies showing
convergence at order two. Not yet independently re-checked: the adversarial pass has covered III.1
and III.2 only.

### Added — semidirect-product brackets via pointwise flat coordinates

`scripts/fable/II1_semidirect_flat.jl` verifies that the push-forward of the constant bracket
K₂ = [0 K; K 0] under the pointwise chart Φ(ρ,u) = (ρ, ρu) produces a Poisson bracket on the
semidirect product — the 1-D compressible Euler and shallow-water systems. The construction
`J = DΦ K₂ DΦ^T` generalises to any antisymmetric K and is exactly Poisson by the Jacobi theorem
for pushforwards. 144 checks verify: Jacobi over ℚ exactly for random antisymmetric K and rational
data; Casimirs and rank; consistency of the three block structure against SymPy; refinement
convergence; and boundary conditions on [0,L] with two antisymmetrisation conventions, both exactly
Poisson.

This is the one fable script that needs SymPy; the other six are pure Julia.

### Added — the structure-function bracket on `T^{2n}`

`scripts/fable/III1_structure_function_4d.jl` proves that the bracket
`{A,B}_c = ∫_M c(f) {A_f, B_f} μ` satisfies the Jacobi identity for every smooth `c` and on any
closed symplectic manifold (M, ω) of dimension 2n, ruling out the provisional hypothesis that the
two-dimensional Plücker relation was essential. The reduction of the Jacobiator to the obstruction
term survives dimension unchanged (cyclicity, skew-adjointness, chain rule); the integrand is not
zero in 4-D and 6-D but is an exact divergence. 61 checks, exact over ℚ(i), verify: the obstruction
on T², T⁴, T⁶ for polynomial `c`; the divergence identity term-by-term; the full Jacobiator by jets
for positive cases and negative controls that must fail; and floating-point spectral refinement
N = 12…32 for non-polynomial `c`.

### Added — the matrix structure-function bracket on `gl(N)`

`scripts/fable/III2_matrix_structure_function.jl` establishes the finite-dimensional analogue of
III.1: the bracket `tr(c(W)[F_W, G_W])` on gl(N) with matrix spectral functions `c`. The Jacobi
identity holds exactly iff `c` is affine, or equivalently iff the antisymmetric edge weight
`κ_ab (w_b − w_a)` in the eigenbasis Jacobiator forms a cocycle on the complete graph of
eigenvalues. The spectral-kernel classification then says which brackets in that wider class *are*
Poisson: exactly the pushforwards of Lie-Poisson under a monotone spectral `ψ`, with slope
`ϖ = 1/ψ^{[1]}` — an infinite family, one member per `ψ`, of which the log-mean bracket
(`ψ = ½ln v`) is the worked example. Restricted to symmetric polynomial slopes of degree at most
two the survivors are only `ϖ = λ₁` and `ϖ = λ₂ ab`. 115 checks over ℚ; semiclassical scaling
`N^{−2}` is measured on Zeitlin's su(N) for four spectral functions.

### Added — multi-field structure functions, and derivative dependence

`scripts/fable/III4_multifield_derivative.jl` settles the two remaining open questions from the
four-bracket paper: (a) the bracket `{A,B} = ∫ c^{ij}(f){A_i, B_j} μ` for several fields f¹…f^m is
Poisson iff the product `(ξ⋆η)_k = ∂_k c^{ij} ξ_i η_j` on T*ℝ^m is associative and (in dimensions
2n ≥ 4) the target one-forms close, and (b) structure functions depending on ∇f never produce
Poisson brackets — the principal symbol forces all first-order derivatives to vanish pointwise.
87 checks prove both theorems exactly over ℚ(i) by jets, verify the necessity lemma (the three
Jacobi functionals obey exactly one relation), test positive and negative cases of multi-field
coupling, and rule out derivative dependence in 2-D and 4-D.

At about eleven minutes it is the slowest script in `scripts/`, which is why the fable scripts
have their own driver rather than a place in `run_all.jl`.

### Added — the four-bracket manuscript

`poisson-brackets-from-four-brackets.tex` arrived with a standalone Julia verification suite of
its own: a `BracketChecks.jl` carrying spectral and 8th-order finite-difference differentiation
on the periodic two-torus, a `CheckSet` harness, and four drivers. It is now part of the package,
on the same terms as the two manuscripts converted from Python in `f897fb0` — shared machinery in
`src/`, diagnoses in `scripts/`.

Three new source files, and no new dependencies:

| file | contains |
|:--|:--|
| `src/torus.jl` | `TorusGrid`, `spectral_grid`, `finite_difference_grid`, `∂x`, `∂y`, `sample`, `integrate`, `canonical_bracket` |
| `src/fourbrackets.jl` | the Gardner and symmetric operators, the Gardner/symmetric/weighted two- and four-brackets with their densities, `lie_poisson_2bracket`, `antisymmetry_residuals`, `plucker_residual`, and a `jacobi_residual` method for the continuum obstruction of Theorem 4.5 |
| `src/metriplectic.jl` | `kulkarni_nomizu` and `metriplectic_bracket`, Section 2 |

`TorusGrid` stores a differentiation **matrix** rather than the original's `Dx::Function` /
`Dy::Function` closures: a derivative is `D * f` or `f * transpose(D)`, so the two schemes share
one concrete type, the spectral derivative costs `O(N³)` through BLAS instead of `O(N⁴)` per call,
and the matrix is antisymmetric — exactly, for the centred stencil — which is where the
antisymmetry of `canonical_bracket` now comes from.

The refactoring exposed one structural fact the original's copies obscured: a two-bracket **is**
its four-bracket with the entropy in the second and fourth slots. `gardner_2bracket` is defined
as `gardner_4bracket(g, a, s, b, s)` and `symmetric_2bracket` likewise, and the weighted brackets
are the symmetric densities times the weight. The tests assert both identifications with `==`.

Four new scripts — `verify_fourbracket_metriplectic.jl`, `_identities.jl`, `_convergence.jl` and
`_log_entropy.jl` — plus `scripts/torustools.jl` for the fixed test fields, which the drivers
carried in three copies. 124 new tests in `test/torus_tests.jl`, `test/fourbrackets_tests.jl` and
`test/metriplectic_tests.jl`.

Every finite-difference residual and observed rate reproduced the original suite to all printed
digits. The spectral residuals moved within `1e-14`–`1e-16` and uniformly downward, the matrix
form accumulating less round-off than a per-call DFT. `docs/src/verification.md` records the
comparison, three defects the fold-in turned up, and the one claim that was added.

### Changed — `scripts/check.jl` learned the convergence idiom

`check_exact` and `check_refined` join `check`, for claims about a continuum identity rather than
a matrix: one settles against an absolute threshold, the other against the factor by which the
residual falls when the resolution is doubled. `check_refined` prints
`3.14e-08 -> 1.25e-10   251x`, because against a predicted 256 the factor *is* the evidence.
`relerr` and `normerr` came along with them. The twenty existing scripts are untouched, and the
new functions know nothing about grids — resolutions are the calling manuscript's business.

`CheckSet`, `check!`, `check_pointwise!` and `report` are gone; the LaTeX labels their table
carried in a column (`eq:cyclicity`, `thm:jacobi`) are now in the check labels, so a line of
output still names the equation it settles.

### Fixed — a relative `[sources]` path does not compose

`scripts/Project.toml` now carries its own `SimpleSolvers` entry. A relative source path is
resolved against the *active* project, so the package's own `../SimpleSolvers` became
`PoissonBrackets/SimpleSolvers` whenever `scripts/` was the active environment and resolution
failed outright — which left the scripts manifest stranded without `Sparspak` and every script
unable to load the package. The entry uses `path` rather than `{rev, url}`: the url form resolves
against a cached clone, which had pinned that environment to 0.12.2 while the working tree was
already at the 0.13 the package requires. `docs/Project.toml` will need the same when it next
resolves.

### The mixed two-field formulation

`Integrator(...; formulation = :mixed)` solves an implicit-midpoint step as `2N` equations in
`(y, v)` instead of `N` in `y`:

```
M (y - uⁿ) - Δt K(ū) v = 0        M v - ∂H/∂u(ū) = 0        ū = (uⁿ + y)/2
```

Eliminating `v` recovers the dense residual exactly, so it is the same step — verified to 12–14
digits over single steps and 100-step runs, with the conserved quantities holding to the same
round-off as before. What it avoids is `Minv * K * Minv`: **the dense Newton matrix is dense
only because the inverse mass matrix is**, and every dynamical use of `Minv` was a mass solve
written as a dense multiply. All four blocks of the mixed Jacobian are banded with circular
bandwidth `p`, and the pattern is fixed for the whole run, so one ordering and symbolic
factorisation serve every step.

One step of implicit midpoint on the second KdV flow, `p = 3`, in milliseconds, both
formulations converging in two Newton iterations:

| N | dense | mixed | speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 64 | 0.192 | 0.259 | 0.74 |
| 128 | 0.518 | 0.485 | 1.07 |
| 384 | 3.34 | 1.56 | **2.1** |
| 1024 | 22.9 | 4.22 | **5.4** |
| 1536 | 58.2 | 6.29 | **9.3** |

The crossover is near `N = 125`, so `:dense` remains the default and the small cases are
unaffected. The gain grows because the dense factorisation is `O(N³)` and the assembly's two
dense `N × N` products are too, where the mixed form is `O(N)` in both.

Restricted to `ImplicitMidpoint` and to an `AffineBracket`; every other combination is an
`ArgumentError` rather than a silently different method. `AverageVectorField` would need an
auxiliary per quadrature node, the discrete-gradient methods carry a rank-one term that would
have to be bordered, and the remaining brackets store the sandwiched `Minv*K*Minv` rather than
`K`.

### `K0` is no longer densified

`AffineBracket`'s constructor called `Matrix(_skew(K0))`, throwing away the sparsity of a
matrix that is banded with circular bandwidth `p` — `mixed_matrix(s, 1, 2)` for KdV, zero for
Camassa-Holm. It is now kept as given, exactly as `Ψ` already was, which is what makes
`kernel_operator` banded and hence the mixed formulation possible at all. It also makes
`poisson_apply`'s `K0 * v` an `O(Np)` matvec instead of `O(N²)`, which the explicit runs pay
four times a step for millions of steps.

`Minv` stays dense, and the analysis paths that genuinely need it — `poisson_matrix`,
`poisson_tensor`, `kernel_tensor`, the Jacobi-identity and Casimir diagnostics — are untouched.

### `kernel_operator`

New: `kernel_operator(b::AffineBracket, û)` is `K0 + kernel_matrix(b, û)`, the weak-form block
without the surrounding inverse mass matrices — `poisson_matrix`'s middle factor, and sparse
where `poisson_matrix` is dense. Together with `kernel_directional`, which the bracket already
provided and which is already `∂(K v)/∂û`, it is everything the mixed Jacobian needs.

### The linear solver for the mixed system is a correctness constraint

`SparspakLU`, not the `UmfpackLU` that SimpleSolvers would otherwise select for a sparse
`Float64` Jacobian. UMFPACK mis-handles this block structure: from `N = 768` upward it returns
a solution wrong by a factor of 150 while reporting success, which surfaces as Newton diverging
from a starting point whose residual was already `1e-5`. Sparspak and dense LAPACK both solve
the same matrices to the accuracy their condition number allows. `Sparspak` is therefore a new
dependency — pure Julia, and light.

### Requires SimpleSolvers 0.13

For the sparse-Jacobian plumbing (`jacobian_prototype`) and the sparse linear solvers.

### Changed — the KdV sign convention is now the textbook one

The equation is `u_t + 6uu_x + u_xxx = 0`, so the `sech²` solitons are **elevations**. The
older `u_t = 6uu_x - u_xxx` is reached by `u → -u`.

The one step that does not follow from a global sign flip is the second structure:
`4u∂ₓ + 2u_x - ∂ₓ³` becomes `-4u∂ₓ - 2u_x - ∂ₓ³` — the transport part flips, the third
derivative does not. That was derived and checked symbolically in jet variables
(`verify_kdv_continuous.py`) *before* any code or prose was touched; in the package it is one
character, `AffineBracket`'s `scale` from `2` to `-2`, `K0` being the `-∂ₓ³` block and keeping
its own sign.

- `H₁ = ½∫(u_x² - 2u³)`, `δH₁/δu = -3u² - u_xx`; `H₂` unchanged;
  `H₃ = ∫(5/2 u⁴ - 5uu_x² + ½u_xx²)`.
- The Magri rung `P²g = 2P¹ ∂H₂/∂û` becomes `-2`, for the same reason.
- `soliton` and `two_soliton` return elevations; the Shi-Fu-Liu correspondence maps by
  `u → u/6` rather than `u → -u/6`, and their mass is `6C₀` rather than `-6C₀`.
- Each Hamiltonian carries the matching sign, so `H₁`, `H₂` and `H₃` take the *same numerical
  values* on corresponding data as before — the elevation soliton here has the `H₁` the
  depression soliton had there, `-6.39998180` at `N = 128`, agreeing with
  `plot_kdv_energies.py` to eight digits. Only `C₀` changes, and it changes sign.
- The Miura map becomes `u = -(v² + v_x)` and its Jacobian `-(2v + ∂ₓ)`. The overall sign
  cancels in `L P¹ Lᵀ`, so the bracket is unchanged; the chart is not, and the Hill potential
  becomes `-u_h`. The Hill threshold for `u = c + sin x + 0.4cos2x` at `N = 20`, `p = 3` moves
  from `+0.470894` to `-0.328741`, the admissible side becoming the negative one.

### Added — a spectral parameter for the Miura chart

`miura_map(space, v̂, λ)` implements `u = -(v² + v_x) - λ`, with `miura_invert(…; λ)` and the
new `miura_lambda`; `MiuraHamiltonian` and `MiuraSystem` take `λ`.

At `λ = 0` the image of the map is a half-space and, sharply, the fields whose Hill operator
is positive definite — which excludes every standard example. **The sign convention was never
what caused that**: flipping it moves the half-space and the solitons together. The
obstruction is spectral, a soliton being a reflectionless potential *with* a bound state.

The parameter is not a shift bolted on but the one the Riccati substitution always had:
`u = -(v² + v_x) - λ` turns into `(-∂ₓ² - u)ψ = λψ`, so `λ` is an eigenvalue parameter of the
very Hill operator that decides invertibility, and a preimage exists exactly when `λ < λ₀`.
That can always be arranged. Measured, with `miura_lambda` a tenth below each threshold, `cos
x`, `sin x + 0.4cos2x`, the single soliton and the two-soliton all enter the chart with a
round-trip error of `10⁻¹⁵`, and the pushforward stays exactly antisymmetric with its
Jacobiator at `10⁻¹⁶`.

`L` does not see a constant, so `MiuraBracket` is unchanged. What moves is *which* bracket the
pushforward is: `L P¹ Lᵀ = P² - 4λP¹`, a member of the bi-Hamiltonian pencil. On the `u` side
the extra term is a constant-speed translation, so the trajectory is the KdV solution in a
uniformly moving frame and all three invariants survive. `scripts/kdv.jl` therefore carries
Miura runs for every case now, not only the `miura` one.

Note that `L P¹ Lᵀ` is **not** the Galerkin `P² - 4λP¹`; measured, they differ by 30-57 %.
That difference is the Jacobi defect the Miura construction exists to remove.

### Changed — `LagrangeSpace` stores its tabulation sparsely

Following `SimpleSplines.SplineQuadrature`: `Φ` is a `SparseMatrixCSC` with `(p+1)` structural
entries per quadrature column (0.8 % of a dense table at `p = 2`, `ne = 192`), the mass matrix
is sparse and wrapped in a `FactorizedMass`, `mixed_matrix` is memoised, and the basis
integrals and a scratch buffer are assembled once. `inverse_mass_matrix` stays dense.

`AffineBracket` no longer densifies the tabulation it is handed — its `Ψ` field was declared
`Matrix{T}` and its constructor called `Matrix`, which threw away the *spline* space's
already-sparse table for the second KdV bracket and the first Camassa-Holm one, both of which
contract it on every Newton iteration. One `jacobian` of the second flow at `N = 384`: **7.24
ms before, 1.26 ms after**, identical results; `bracket_directional` alone 25× faster, the
`LagrangeSpace` assemblies about 30×. The two `O(N³)` tensor routines densify locally and
deliberately — they random-access the table rather than contracting it, and are off the time
loop by construction.

### Removed — the local `LapackLU`

SimpleSolvers 0.12.2 ships it, with a superset of the behaviour: a `BlasFloat` guard,
feature-detected allocation-free `getrf!`, `singular_index`, `factorization` and the full
`solve!` surface. `src/linearsolver.jl` is gone and the name is re-exported from SimpleSolvers,
so `linear_solver_method = LapackLU()` keeps working for anyone who has only done
`using PoissonBrackets`. `[compat]` requires `SimpleSolvers = "0.12.2"`.

The local `ldiv!` threw a message-carrying exception; upstream throws
`LinearAlgebra.SingularException(info)`. The explanatory text now lives in `_step!`, which
already owns the "step size is probably too large" warning.

### Fixed

- **`project!` never worked on a `LagrangeSpace`.** `mass_factorization` returned a bare dense
  `Cholesky`, and the generic `project!` goes through `mass_solve!`, which has methods only for
  a `MassOperator`. Every in-place projection onto a Lagrange space was a `MethodError`, and
  nothing exercised it. Now tested.
- **`integrate` dropped the tail of every run.** `nout = nsteps ÷ stride` ran `nout*stride`
  steps while the tables reported `nsteps` — 766400 of a claimed 766781 for the explicit
  cosine run, ending at `T = 99.95`. Now a ceiling with a final short window, as
  `plot_kdv_energies.py` does.
- **The Burgers `√u` convention was inconsistent with its own docstring.**
  `to_sqrt_variables` used `ū = 2√u` while the displayed bracket was `K/4`, which belongs to
  `ū = √u`. Both are now the manuscript's `ū = √u`. The transformation and the factor move
  together, and pairing them wrongly makes the flow four times too slow — which no
  conservation test can see, a constant rescaling of a Poisson field preserving every Casimir,
  every energy bound and every convergence *rate*. There is now a test comparing against the
  pushforward of the `u`-space field, which is the only thing that catches it. The same error
  was found and fixed in `verify_burgers_discretisation.py`.
- `scripts/kdv.jl` used `min(dt_rk4, case.dt)` for the explicit runs where
  `plot_kdv_energies.py` uses `dt_rk4` outright. Invisible on four of six cases; on `soliton5`
  it forced 0.0625 instead of 0.065 and hid the point the benchmark makes. The output stride
  now rounds as the Python does.
- Claims inherited from the manuscript's own list of known defects: the Miura image bound is
  `C₀ ≥ 0` and not strict; the critical set of `Dℳ_h` is quoted as evidence rather than proof,
  with the exact statement that *does* hold added — `∫v_h` is a Casimir of `P¹` in that chart,
  so the flow cannot reach the degeneracy from data off it, now a test; and Ge-Marsden is
  given as the reason to expect the energy/structure trade-off rather than a proof of it for
  these brackets, whose non-degeneracy hypotheses are unchecked.

### Added — documentation

- **Seven new pages, for the material the port added and never explained.** Commit `f897fb0`
  added four source modules, twenty-four scripts and three plotting routines, and touched
  `docs/` only with bare `@autodocs` blocks — everything was reachable and almost nothing was
  explained.

  | page | covers |
  |:--|:--|
  | `diagnostics.md` | the theory of every measurement the package makes, organised by what is being measured: whether the *bracket* is Poisson, whether the *flow* conserves what it should, whether the *method* preserves the structure. Why `jacobi_residual` is normalised the way it is, why a flat residual is the answer and not a failure to converge, why `integrate` reports windowed maxima, why `drift` throws on a vanishing reference, and how to tell a drift from accumulated round-off |
  | `liepoisson.md` | the second manuscript: the Dubrovin-Novikov factorisation, prescribing the Casimir, the structure-constant condition and the closure/consistency split, the algebra zoo, and the two four-bracket ansätze |
  | `dirac.md` | the Dirac companion: the Dirac bracket, the tensorial transport of the Jacobiator that makes reduction faithful but never curative, the four realisations, the broken hierarchical space, and the repair search |
  | `bea.md` | §6 of the KdV notes: the modified Hamiltonian, `H₂` as the momentum of the projected translation, the closed-form defect, the exact increment lemma, and how to read `sweepplot` |

  | `scripts.md` | an index of all twenty-two verification scripts against the claims they check and the pages that carry the theory |
  | `fourbrackets.md` | the third manuscript: Kulkarni-Nomizu positivity, the two antisymmetry conditions and why there are two families, the Gardner operators, both reductions to `∫u[A_u,B_u]` and the factor of two between them, the Plücker relation that collapses the Jacobi obstruction, the log-entropy weight's singularity, and Section 6's construction that generates nothing |

- **Three module-overview docstrings were being dropped from the build without a word.** The
  headers of `src/algebras.jl`, `src/dirac.jl` and `src/hierarchical.jl` were `@doc raw"…"`
  blocks attached to no binding — the `C[m,i,j]` index convention, the definition of the Dirac
  bracket and the second-class condition, and the whole rationale for the broken space reached
  no reader of the manual. The prose now lives on the pages above and the file headers are plain
  comments.

- `DiscreteGradient` was exported with no docstring, so it rendered nowhere and
  `[`DiscreteGradient`](@ref)` could not resolve. It has one.

- **`docs/src/discretisation.md` contradicted `docs/src/verification.md`.** Testing trap 1 still
  asserted that every three-dimensional antisymmetric bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity — the
  claim recorded three sections away as an erratum. Corrected to Bianchi class A.

- The `exact.jl`, `algebras.jl`, `dirac.jl`, `hierarchical.jl` and `diagnostics.jl` `@autodocs`
  blocks move from `library.md` to their topic pages, as the equation modules already had.
  `@index` is unchanged and complete.

- `docs/src/verification.md`, recording what the package has been checked against claim by
  claim: the RK4 comparison, the `ρ` cross-check against three independent sources, the
  divergences found and fixed, the errata found in the Python, every item of the manuscript's
  error list dispositioned as inherited-and-fixed, paper-only or still open, and the fact that
  **Camassa-Holm has no reference at all** — neither manuscript covers it and neither
  `Scripts/` directory mentions it, so it is a prototype in the strict sense and must not be
  read as verified.
- A test asserting `stability_limit` against the `ρ = 115, 274, 907, 2170` of the notes, so a
  change in the assembly fails a test rather than drifting away from the manuscript.

### The RK4 question

The RK4 results for the `cos` and single-soliton runs were suspected of disagreeing with the
Python. **They do not.** `Δt` is identical to full precision (766781 and 23833 steps on both
sides) and every quantity above round-off agrees to every digit the tables print. What differs
is confined to round-off-dominated columns, and `|ΔC₀|` — conserved exactly in exact
arithmetic — is the internal control that shows it: 7.7e-12 in Python against 4.7e-12 in Julia
over 766781 steps. Any `|ΔH|` reported at that order is arithmetic, not dynamics.

### Added — the initial feature set

This is the list the package was seeded with, kept as written. Everything above is what happened
to it before it was first registered.

- Discrete function spaces: `SplineSpace`, wrapping the periodic B-spline basis of
  SimpleSplines, and `LagrangeSpace`, a periodic nodal Lagrange finite element space built
  on the reference-element bases of CompactBasisFunctions.
- Discrete brackets: `ConstantBracket`, `AffineBracket`, `GaugedBracket` and `MiuraBracket`,
  with a common interface of `poisson_matrix`, `poisson_apply`, `isantisymmetric` and
  `jacobi_residual`.
- Discrete Hamiltonians and Casimirs for the Burgers, KdV and Camassa-Holm equations, each
  with an analytic gradient and Hessian.
- Geometric integrators: implicit midpoint, the average vector field method, the Gonzalez
  discrete gradient in the Euclidean and mass metrics, explicit Euler and Runge-Kutta 4,
  and a projection method that imposes several invariants at once.
- Diagnostics: fused evaluation of the invariants, integration with windowed error
  envelopes, and the Poisson-map defect.
- The Miura chart: `MiuraBracket`, the pushforward of the first bracket along the Miura map
  (`u = v² + v_x` at the time; see above for the sign convention and for `λ`), antisymmetric *and* Poisson to round-off at every resolution where the
  Galerkin second bracket fails the Jacobi identity at order one; `MiuraSystem`, carrying
  the mKdV degrees of freedom in which the bracket is constant; `miura_map`, `miura_invert`
  and `hill_lambda0` for moving between the two charts and for deciding whether a given
  field has a preimage at all.
- Initial conditions for every example of the manuscript: `cosine`, `soliton`,
  `two_soliton`, `three_solitons`, `five_solitons` and `miura_initial_v`, with
  `scripts/kdv.jl` running all six cases and writing a markdown summary per case.
- `LapackLU`, a LAPACK-backed factorisation plugged into SimpleSolvers' linear-solver
  extension points; submitted upstream as
  [JuliaGNI/SimpleSolvers.jl#183](https://github.com/JuliaGNI/SimpleSolvers.jl/pull/183),
  merged and released in SimpleSolvers 0.12.2, and consequently removed again here — see
  above.

### The Newton residual tolerance

`f_abstol` is an **absolute** tolerance, and it has to sit above the round-off floor of the
residual — which scales with the number of degrees of freedom *and* with the amplitude of the
field. Both ways of getting it wrong were measured, on implicit midpoint on the second KdV
flow, and neither is acceptable:

| `f_abstol` | iterations, ‖u‖≈4 | \|ΔH₂\|, ‖u‖≈4 | iterations, ‖u‖≈1 | \|ΔH₂\|, ‖u‖≈1 |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| `max(8,N)·eps` | 40.0 | 5.8e-15 | 40.0 | 5.7e-16 |
| **`4·max(8,N)·eps·‖û₀‖`** | **3.0** | **6.4e-15** | **2.5** | **7.1e-16** |
| `16·…` | 2.9 | 6.2e-14 | 2.0 | 5.7e-16 |
| `1e-11` | 2.6 | 9.6e-13 | 2.0 | 5.7e-16 |

Below the floor Newton reaches its limit in three iterations and then spins to the iteration
cap making no progress, reporting non-convergence on a step it has in fact solved. Above it
Newton stops early and the conservation laws pay — an order of magnitude of `H₂` per factor
of sixteen. The window is not wide, which is why this is a formula and not a constant, and
why `Integrator` takes `û₀`: an absolute tolerance cannot serve a field of size one and a
field of size four at once.

`min_iterations = 1`, and a step whose first attempt does not converge is redone with a line
search rather than accepted. That fallback is a safeguard against an over-large step size,
not a remedy for a mis-set tolerance, and it does not fire at these settings.

### Performance

An implicit step at `N = 384` went from 45 ms to 4.2 ms. In order of what each change bought:

- SimpleSolvers' hand-written scalar LU accounted for 74 % of a step; `LapackLU` replaces
  the factorisation while keeping the whole nonlinear driver. (It now lives upstream.)
- The basis tabulation is now sparse in SimpleSplines, so the assembly of one Hessian at
  `N = 384` fell from 6.0 ms to 0.4 ms, and the constant assemblies are memoised rather
  than rebuilt on every Newton iteration.
- The default line search is `Static`: at these step sizes Newton converges in two or three
  iterations and backtracking only adds residual evaluations.
- Mass solves go through SimpleSplines' `MassOperator`, which uses planned real FFTs on a
  uniform mesh, where the matrix is circulant. This is the right representation of the
  operator but not where the time went: 0.064 ms to 0.001 ms, against a 4.2 ms step.
