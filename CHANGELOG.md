## [0.1.0]

Initial release.

### Added

- Discrete function spaces: `SplineSpace`, wrapping the periodic B-spline basis of
  SimpleSplines, and `LagrangeSpace`, a periodic nodal Lagrange finite element space built
  on the reference-element bases of CompactBasisFunctions.
- Discrete brackets: `ConstantBracket`, `AffineBracket`, `GaugedBracket` and `MiuraBracket`,
  with a common interface of `poisson_matrix`, `poisson_apply`, `isantisymmetric` and
  `jacobi_residual`.
- Discrete Hamiltonians and Casimirs for the Burgers, KdV and Camassa-Holm equations, each
  with an analytic gradient and Hessian.
- Geometric integrators: implicit midpoint, the average vector field method, the Gonzalez
  discrete gradient in the Euclidean and mass metrics, explicit Euler and Runge-Kutta 4,
  and a projection method that imposes several invariants at once.
- Diagnostics: fused evaluation of the invariants, integration with windowed error
  envelopes, and the Poisson-map defect.
- The Miura chart: `MiuraBracket`, the pushforward of the first bracket along
  `u = v² + v_x`, antisymmetric *and* Poisson to round-off at every resolution where the
  Galerkin second bracket fails the Jacobi identity at order one; `MiuraSystem`, carrying
  the mKdV degrees of freedom in which the bracket is constant; `miura_map`, `miura_invert`
  and `hill_lambda0` for moving between the two charts and for deciding whether a given
  field has a preimage at all.
- Initial conditions for every example of the manuscript: `cosine`, `soliton`,
  `two_soliton`, `three_solitons`, `five_solitons` and `miura_initial_v`, with
  `scripts/kdv.jl` running all six cases and writing a markdown summary per case.
- `LapackLU`, a LAPACK-backed factorisation plugged into SimpleSolvers' linear-solver
  extension points; submitted upstream as
  [JuliaGNI/SimpleSolvers.jl#183](https://github.com/JuliaGNI/SimpleSolvers.jl/pull/183).

### The Newton residual tolerance

`f_abstol` is an **absolute** tolerance, and it has to sit above the round-off floor of the
residual — which scales with the number of degrees of freedom *and* with the amplitude of the
field. Both ways of getting it wrong were measured, on implicit midpoint on the second KdV
flow, and neither is acceptable:

| `f_abstol` | iterations, ‖u‖≈4 | \|ΔH₂\|, ‖u‖≈4 | iterations, ‖u‖≈1 | \|ΔH₂\|, ‖u‖≈1 |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| `max(8,N)·eps` | 40.0 | 5.8e-15 | 40.0 | 5.7e-16 |
| **`4·max(8,N)·eps·‖û₀‖`** | **3.0** | **6.4e-15** | **2.5** | **7.1e-16** |
| `16·…` | 2.9 | 6.2e-14 | 2.0 | 5.7e-16 |
| `1e-11` | 2.6 | 9.6e-13 | 2.0 | 5.7e-16 |

Below the floor Newton reaches its limit in three iterations and then spins to the iteration
cap making no progress, reporting non-convergence on a step it has in fact solved. Above it
Newton stops early and the conservation laws pay — an order of magnitude of `H₂` per factor
of sixteen. The window is not wide, which is why this is a formula and not a constant, and
why `Integrator` takes `û₀`: an absolute tolerance cannot serve a field of size one and a
field of size four at once.

`min_iterations = 1`, and a step whose first attempt does not converge is redone with a line
search rather than accepted. That fallback is a safeguard against an over-large step size,
not a remedy for a mis-set tolerance, and it does not fire at these settings.

### Performance

An implicit step at `N = 384` went from 45 ms to 4.2 ms. In order of what each change bought:

- SimpleSolvers' hand-written scalar LU accounted for 74 % of a step; `LapackLU` replaces
  the factorisation while keeping the whole nonlinear driver.
- The basis tabulation is now sparse in SimpleSplines, so the assembly of one Hessian at
  `N = 384` fell from 6.0 ms to 0.4 ms, and the constant assemblies are memoised rather
  than rebuilt on every Newton iteration.
- The default line search is `Static`: at these step sizes Newton converges in two or three
  iterations and backtracking only adds residual evaluations.
- Mass solves go through SimpleSplines' `MassOperator`, which uses planned real FFTs on a
  uniform mesh, where the matrix is circulant. This is the right representation of the
  operator but not where the time went: 0.064 ms to 0.001 ms, against a 4.2 ms step.
