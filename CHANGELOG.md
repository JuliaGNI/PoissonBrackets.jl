## [Unreleased]

`0.1.0` has not shipped, so this may be folded into it; it is kept separate because the
first item changes what every number in the package means.

### Changed — the KdV sign convention is now the textbook one

The equation is `u_t + 6uu_x + u_xxx = 0`, so the `sech²` solitons are **elevations**. The
older `u_t = 6uu_x - u_xxx` is reached by `u → -u`.

The one step that does not follow from a global sign flip is the second structure:
`4u∂ₓ + 2u_x - ∂ₓ³` becomes `-4u∂ₓ - 2u_x - ∂ₓ³` — the transport part flips, the third
derivative does not. That was derived and checked symbolically in jet variables
(`verify_kdv_continuous.py`) *before* any code or prose was touched; in the package it is one
character, `AffineBracket`'s `scale` from `2` to `-2`, `K0` being the `-∂ₓ³` block and keeping
its own sign.

- `H₁ = ½∫(u_x² - 2u³)`, `δH₁/δu = -3u² - u_xx`; `H₂` unchanged;
  `H₃ = ∫(5/2 u⁴ - 5uu_x² + ½u_xx²)`.
- The Magri rung `P²g = 2P¹ ∂H₂/∂û` becomes `-2`, for the same reason.
- `soliton` and `two_soliton` return elevations; the Shi-Fu-Liu correspondence maps by
  `u → u/6` rather than `u → -u/6`, and their mass is `6C₀` rather than `-6C₀`.
- Each Hamiltonian carries the matching sign, so `H₁`, `H₂` and `H₃` take the *same numerical
  values* on corresponding data as before — the elevation soliton here has the `H₁` the
  depression soliton had there, `-6.39998180` at `N = 128`, agreeing with
  `plot_kdv_energies.py` to eight digits. Only `C₀` changes, and it changes sign.
- The Miura map becomes `u = -(v² + v_x)` and its Jacobian `-(2v + ∂ₓ)`. The overall sign
  cancels in `L P¹ Lᵀ`, so the bracket is unchanged; the chart is not, and the Hill potential
  becomes `-u_h`. The Hill threshold for `u = c + sin x + 0.4cos2x` at `N = 20`, `p = 3` moves
  from `+0.470894` to `-0.328741`, the admissible side becoming the negative one.

### Added — a spectral parameter for the Miura chart

`miura_map(space, v̂, λ)` implements `u = -(v² + v_x) - λ`, with `miura_invert(…; λ)` and the
new `miura_lambda`; `MiuraHamiltonian` and `MiuraSystem` take `λ`.

At `λ = 0` the image of the map is a half-space and, sharply, the fields whose Hill operator
is positive definite — which excludes every standard example. **The sign convention was never
what caused that**: flipping it moves the half-space and the solitons together. The
obstruction is spectral, a soliton being a reflectionless potential *with* a bound state.

The parameter is not a shift bolted on but the one the Riccati substitution always had:
`u = -(v² + v_x) - λ` turns into `(-∂ₓ² - u)ψ = λψ`, so `λ` is an eigenvalue parameter of the
very Hill operator that decides invertibility, and a preimage exists exactly when `λ < λ₀`.
That can always be arranged. Measured, with `miura_lambda` a tenth below each threshold, `cos
x`, `sin x + 0.4cos2x`, the single soliton and the two-soliton all enter the chart with a
round-trip error of `10⁻¹⁵`, and the pushforward stays exactly antisymmetric with its
Jacobiator at `10⁻¹⁶`.

`L` does not see a constant, so `MiuraBracket` is unchanged. What moves is *which* bracket the
pushforward is: `L P¹ Lᵀ = P² - 4λP¹`, a member of the bi-Hamiltonian pencil. On the `u` side
the extra term is a constant-speed translation, so the trajectory is the KdV solution in a
uniformly moving frame and all three invariants survive. `scripts/kdv.jl` therefore carries
Miura runs for every case now, not only the `miura` one.

Note that `L P¹ Lᵀ` is **not** the Galerkin `P² - 4λP¹`; measured, they differ by 30-57 %.
That difference is the Jacobi defect the Miura construction exists to remove.

### Changed — `LagrangeSpace` stores its tabulation sparsely

Following `SimpleSplines.SplineQuadrature`: `Φ` is a `SparseMatrixCSC` with `(p+1)` structural
entries per quadrature column (0.8 % of a dense table at `p = 2`, `ne = 192`), the mass matrix
is sparse and wrapped in a `FactorizedMass`, `mixed_matrix` is memoised, and the basis
integrals and a scratch buffer are assembled once. `inverse_mass_matrix` stays dense.

`AffineBracket` no longer densifies the tabulation it is handed — its `Ψ` field was declared
`Matrix{T}` and its constructor called `Matrix`, which threw away the *spline* space's
already-sparse table for the second KdV bracket and the first Camassa-Holm one, both of which
contract it on every Newton iteration. One `jacobian` of the second flow at `N = 384`: **7.24
ms before, 1.26 ms after**, identical results; `bracket_directional` alone 25× faster, the
`LagrangeSpace` assemblies about 30×. The two `O(N³)` tensor routines densify locally and
deliberately — they random-access the table rather than contracting it, and are off the time
loop by construction.

### Removed — the local `LapackLU`

SimpleSolvers 0.12.2 ships it, with a superset of the behaviour: a `BlasFloat` guard,
feature-detected allocation-free `getrf!`, `singular_index`, `factorization` and the full
`solve!` surface. `src/linearsolver.jl` is gone and the name is re-exported from SimpleSolvers,
so `linear_solver_method = LapackLU()` keeps working for anyone who has only done
`using PoissonBrackets`. `[compat]` requires `SimpleSolvers = "0.12.2"`.

The local `ldiv!` threw a message-carrying exception; upstream throws
`LinearAlgebra.SingularException(info)`. The explanatory text now lives in `_step!`, which
already owns the "step size is probably too large" warning.

### Fixed

- **`project!` never worked on a `LagrangeSpace`.** `mass_factorization` returned a bare dense
  `Cholesky`, and the generic `project!` goes through `mass_solve!`, which has methods only for
  a `MassOperator`. Every in-place projection onto a Lagrange space was a `MethodError`, and
  nothing exercised it. Now tested.
- **`integrate` dropped the tail of every run.** `nout = nsteps ÷ stride` ran `nout*stride`
  steps while the tables reported `nsteps` — 766400 of a claimed 766781 for the explicit
  cosine run, ending at `T = 99.95`. Now a ceiling with a final short window, as
  `plot_kdv_energies.py` does.
- **The Burgers `√u` convention was inconsistent with its own docstring.**
  `to_sqrt_variables` used `ū = 2√u` while the displayed bracket was `K/4`, which belongs to
  `ū = √u`. Both are now the manuscript's `ū = √u`. The transformation and the factor move
  together, and pairing them wrongly makes the flow four times too slow — which no
  conservation test can see, a constant rescaling of a Poisson field preserving every Casimir,
  every energy bound and every convergence *rate*. There is now a test comparing against the
  pushforward of the `u`-space field, which is the only thing that catches it. The same error
  was found and fixed in `verify_burgers_discretisation.py`.
- `scripts/kdv.jl` used `min(dt_rk4, case.dt)` for the explicit runs where
  `plot_kdv_energies.py` uses `dt_rk4` outright. Invisible on four of six cases; on `soliton5`
  it forced 0.0625 instead of 0.065 and hid the point the benchmark makes. The output stride
  now rounds as the Python does.
- Claims inherited from the manuscript's own list of known defects: the Miura image bound is
  `C₀ ≥ 0` and not strict; the critical set of `Dℳ_h` is quoted as evidence rather than proof,
  with the exact statement that *does* hold added — `∫v_h` is a Casimir of `P¹` in that chart,
  so the flow cannot reach the degeneracy from data off it, now a test; and Ge-Marsden is
  given as the reason to expect the energy/structure trade-off rather than a proof of it for
  these brackets, whose non-degeneracy hypotheses are unchecked.

### Added — documentation

- `docs/src/verification.md`, recording what the package has been checked against claim by
  claim: the RK4 comparison, the `ρ` cross-check against three independent sources, the
  divergences found and fixed, the errata found in the Python, every item of the manuscript's
  error list dispositioned as inherited-and-fixed, paper-only or still open, and the fact that
  **Camassa-Holm has no reference at all** — neither manuscript covers it and neither
  `Scripts/` directory mentions it, so it is a prototype in the strict sense and must not be
  read as verified.
- A test asserting `stability_limit` against the `ρ = 115, 274, 907, 2170` of the notes, so a
  change in the assembly fails a test rather than drifting away from the manuscript.

### The RK4 question

The RK4 results for the `cos` and single-soliton runs were suspected of disagreeing with the
Python. **They do not.** `Δt` is identical to full precision (766781 and 23833 steps on both
sides) and every quantity above round-off agrees to every digit the tables print. What differs
is confined to round-off-dominated columns, and `|ΔC₀|` — conserved exactly in exact
arithmetic — is the internal control that shows it: 7.7e-12 in Python against 4.7e-12 in Julia
over 766781 steps. Any `|ΔH|` reported at that order is arithmetic, not dynamics.

## [0.1.0]

Initial release.

### Added

- Discrete function spaces: `SplineSpace`, wrapping the periodic B-spline basis of
  SimpleSplines, and `LagrangeSpace`, a periodic nodal Lagrange finite element space built
  on the reference-element bases of CompactBasisFunctions.
- Discrete brackets: `ConstantBracket`, `AffineBracket`, `GaugedBracket` and `MiuraBracket`,
  with a common interface of `poisson_matrix`, `poisson_apply`, `isantisymmetric` and
  `jacobi_residual`.
- Discrete Hamiltonians and Casimirs for the Burgers, KdV and Camassa-Holm equations, each
  with an analytic gradient and Hessian.
- Geometric integrators: implicit midpoint, the average vector field method, the Gonzalez
  discrete gradient in the Euclidean and mass metrics, explicit Euler and Runge-Kutta 4,
  and a projection method that imposes several invariants at once.
- Diagnostics: fused evaluation of the invariants, integration with windowed error
  envelopes, and the Poisson-map defect.
- The Miura chart: `MiuraBracket`, the pushforward of the first bracket along the Miura map
  (`u = v² + v_x` at the time; see Unreleased for the sign convention and for `λ`), antisymmetric *and* Poisson to round-off at every resolution where the
  Galerkin second bracket fails the Jacobi identity at order one; `MiuraSystem`, carrying
  the mKdV degrees of freedom in which the bracket is constant; `miura_map`, `miura_invert`
  and `hill_lambda0` for moving between the two charts and for deciding whether a given
  field has a preimage at all.
- Initial conditions for every example of the manuscript: `cosine`, `soliton`,
  `two_soliton`, `three_solitons`, `five_solitons` and `miura_initial_v`, with
  `scripts/kdv.jl` running all six cases and writing a markdown summary per case.
- `LapackLU`, a LAPACK-backed factorisation plugged into SimpleSolvers' linear-solver
  extension points; submitted upstream as
  [JuliaGNI/SimpleSolvers.jl#183](https://github.com/JuliaGNI/SimpleSolvers.jl/pull/183),
  merged and released in SimpleSolvers 0.12.2, and consequently removed again here — see
  Unreleased.

### The Newton residual tolerance

`f_abstol` is an **absolute** tolerance, and it has to sit above the round-off floor of the
residual — which scales with the number of degrees of freedom *and* with the amplitude of the
field. Both ways of getting it wrong were measured, on implicit midpoint on the second KdV
flow, and neither is acceptable:

| `f_abstol` | iterations, ‖u‖≈4 | \|ΔH₂\|, ‖u‖≈4 | iterations, ‖u‖≈1 | \|ΔH₂\|, ‖u‖≈1 |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| `max(8,N)·eps` | 40.0 | 5.8e-15 | 40.0 | 5.7e-16 |
| **`4·max(8,N)·eps·‖û₀‖`** | **3.0** | **6.4e-15** | **2.5** | **7.1e-16** |
| `16·…` | 2.9 | 6.2e-14 | 2.0 | 5.7e-16 |
| `1e-11` | 2.6 | 9.6e-13 | 2.0 | 5.7e-16 |

Below the floor Newton reaches its limit in three iterations and then spins to the iteration
cap making no progress, reporting non-convergence on a step it has in fact solved. Above it
Newton stops early and the conservation laws pay — an order of magnitude of `H₂` per factor
of sixteen. The window is not wide, which is why this is a formula and not a constant, and
why `Integrator` takes `û₀`: an absolute tolerance cannot serve a field of size one and a
field of size four at once.

`min_iterations = 1`, and a step whose first attempt does not converge is redone with a line
search rather than accepted. That fallback is a safeguard against an over-large step size,
not a remedy for a mis-set tolerance, and it does not fire at these settings.

### Performance

An implicit step at `N = 384` went from 45 ms to 4.2 ms. In order of what each change bought:

- SimpleSolvers' hand-written scalar LU accounted for 74 % of a step; `LapackLU` replaces
  the factorisation while keeping the whole nonlinear driver. (It now lives upstream.)
- The basis tabulation is now sparse in SimpleSplines, so the assembly of one Hessian at
  `N = 384` fell from 6.0 ms to 0.4 ms, and the constant assemblies are memoised rather
  than rebuilt on every Newton iteration.
- The default line search is `Static`: at these step sizes Newton converges in two or three
  iterations and backtracking only adds residual evaluations.
- Mass solves go through SimpleSplines' `MassOperator`, which uses planned real FFTs on a
  uniform mesh, where the matrix is circulant. This is the right representation of the
  operator but not where the time went: 0.064 ms to 0.001 ms, against a 4.2 ms step.
