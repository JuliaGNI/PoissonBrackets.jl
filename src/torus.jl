    TorusGrid{T, DT}

A uniform periodic grid on the two-torus ``\Omega = [0, 2\pi]^2``, carrying the
differentiation matrix of one particular scheme.

Fields are sampled as `N`-by-`N` arrays whose first index runs over ``x`` and second over
``y``, so that `f[i,j]` is the value at `(nodes[i], nodes[j])`. Everything is periodic, which
is what makes all boundary terms arising from integration by parts vanish — the assumption
under which the identities of *Poisson brackets from four-brackets* are stated.

# One type, two schemes

The two schemes differ only in the matrix `D`, so they share a type rather than forming a
hierarchy:

  * [`spectral_grid`](@ref) — Fourier differentiation, exact to roundoff for fields that are
    band-limited below the Nyquist mode. Used for the identities that are pure algebra plus
    integration by parts, where the residual is expected at `1e-15`.
  * [`finite_difference_grid`](@ref) — 8th-order centred differences, for identities
    involving non-band-limited functions of ``u`` (``u^{3/2}``, ``\log u``, quotients
    ``A_u/S_u``). Those are certified by their observed convergence rate rather than by an
    absolute threshold.

# Why a matrix and not a closure

A derivative is one matrix product: ``\partial_x f = D f`` and ``\partial_y f = f D^\top``,
both ``O(N^3)`` through BLAS for the dense spectral `D` and ``O(N^2)`` for the sparse
finite-difference one. Storing the scheme as a `Function` field instead would leave the type
abstract at every call site, and a spectral derivative evaluated by a naive DFT per call
costs ``O(N^4)`` — which is why such an implementation can only be used at very small `N`.

`D` is antisymmetric for both schemes, exactly and not just to roundoff in the
finite-difference case. That is a property of a centred stencil on a periodic grid, and
[`canonical_bracket`](@ref) inherits its antisymmetry from it.

@doc raw"""
    spectral_grid(N)

A [`TorusGrid`](@ref) of `N` points per direction differentiating by the discrete Fourier
transform.

The differentiation matrix is assembled once as ``D = \Re\,(V \Lambda W)``, where `W` and `V`
are the forward and inverse one-dimensional DFT matrices and ``\Lambda = \mathrm{diag}(i
k_p)`` holds the wavenumbers. For a real field this is identical to transforming, multiplying
by ``ik``, and transforming back, but it costs one matrix product per derivative instead of
two transforms.

# The wavenumber wrap, and the Nyquist mode

Wavenumbers are wrapped as `k = p <= N÷2 ? p : p - N`, so for even `N` the mode `p = N÷2`
is assigned `+N/2` rather than `-N/2`. That asymmetry is harmless: the Fourier coefficient of
a real field at the Nyquist mode is real, so its contribution to the derivative is purely
imaginary and is removed by taking the real part. Equivalently, `D` has no Nyquist component
at all, which is what leaves it antisymmetric.

Derivatives are then exact to roundoff for any field band-limited strictly below `N÷2`, and
`N = 16` is ample for the trigonometric test fields of the manuscript, whose highest mode is
three.

A [`TorusGrid`](@ref) of `N` points per direction differentiating by the 8th-order centred
stencil [`FD8_COEFFICIENTS`](@ref), stored as a sparse circulant matrix.

Used for every identity involving a function of ``u`` that is not a trigonometric polynomial
— ``u^{3/2}``, ``\log u``, the quotient ``A_u/S_u`` — where Fourier differentiation is no
longer exact and the residual is discretisation error rather than a defect of the identity.
Such a claim is settled by refinement: doubling `N` must divide the residual by a factor
approaching ``2^8 = 256``. See `scripts/verify_fourbracket_convergence.jl`, which measures
observed orders of 7.2 to 8.1.

`N` must be at least nine, so that the four-point half-stencil does not reach around the grid
and overlap itself.

halve — and for a band-limited field it is exact, since every non-constant Fourier mode sums
to zero over a full period. So on a [`spectral_grid`](@ref) this quadrature contributes no
error of its own to the identities, and any residual that remains is the identity's.

This is the Poisson bracket of the plane read as a symplectic manifold with ``x`` and ``y``
