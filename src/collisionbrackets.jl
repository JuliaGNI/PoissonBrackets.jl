    CollisionBracket(space, φ̂; mobility = 1, mobility_derivative = nothing, density = 1)
    CollisionBracket(space, Λ; mobility = 1, mobility_derivative = nothing, density = 1)

The collision-like metric bracket of a two-dimensional field,

```math
(F, G) = \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega \! \int_\Omega
    \kappa(x, x') \,
    \big( \nabla f(x) - \nabla f(x') \big)^T
    Q_2 \big( \nabla \phi(x) - \nabla \phi(x') \big)
    \big( \nabla g(x) - \nabla g(x') \big) \, d\mu(x') \, d\mu(x) ,
```

with ``f = \delta F / \delta u``, ``g = \delta G / \delta u``, ``\phi = \delta H / \delta u``,
the factorised kernel ``\kappa(x, x') = M(x, u(x)) \, M(x', u(x'))`` and
``Q_2(z) = |z|^2 \mathbb{I} - z \otimes z``.

Degeneracy is structural and needs no cancellation between distant terms: setting ``G = H``
makes the last factor ``\nabla \phi(x) - \nabla \phi(x') = z``, and ``Q_2(z) \, z = 0``
identically, at every *pair* of quadrature points. Positive semi-definiteness is equally
structural — ``Q_2`` is positive semi-definite and ``\kappa > 0``, so ``(F, F) \ge 0``.

# The collapse, which is what makes it affordable

Written as it stands, every outer quadrature node carries a full inner quadrature and one
assembly costs ``O(N_q^2)`` — some ``10^{10}`` pair evaluations at ``64^2`` cells. It does not
have to. In two dimensions ``Q_2(z) = z^\perp \otimes z^\perp`` **exactly**, with
``z^\perp = (-z_2, z_1)``, and perping is linear, so with ``\beta = (\nabla \phi)^\perp`` the
kernel is ``(\beta(x) - \beta(x')) \otimes (\beta(x) - \beta(x'))`` — a *quadratic* in the
inner point. The inner integral is therefore a fixed set of global moments, evaluated once,
after which everything is pointwise-local in ``x``. Because one fixed global quadrature rule
serves the inner sum at every outer point, the collapse is exact **at the quadrature level**
and perturbs no discrete conservation property.

The moments are accumulated in the **recentred** variables ``\gamma = \beta - \bar\beta``,
``\bar\beta = m_0^{-1} \int \beta M \, d\mu``:

```math
m_0 = \int M d\mu , \qquad
q_1 = \int \gamma \, M d\mu \; (= 0) , \qquad
\Sigma = \int \gamma \otimes \gamma \, M d\mu ,
```

and the diffusion tensor of the manuscript is

```math
\mathbb{D}_s(u; x) = \int_\Omega Q_2 \big( \nabla \phi(x) - \nabla \phi(x') \big) M \, d\mu'
    = m_0 \, \gamma \otimes \gamma - \gamma \otimes q_1 - q_1 \otimes \gamma + \Sigma .
```

Recentring is a **correctness requirement, not a refinement**. ``\Sigma`` is accumulated as
``\int (\beta - \bar\beta) \otimes (\beta - \bar\beta) M d\mu'`` directly; forming it instead
as ``M_2 - m_0 \bar\beta \otimes \bar\beta`` reinstates exactly the cancellation the centring
removes, and with it the amplification ``|\alpha|^2 m_0 / \| \mathbb{D}_s \|`` that blows up
when ``\nabla \phi`` has a large mean and a small variation — a plausible relaxed
Grad-Shafranov state. Measured in `scripts/verify_metric_collapse.jl`: at a gradient spread of
``10^{-7}`` the uncentred form's relative error passes 1 and it goes indefinite in 180 of 200
draws, while the centred form stays positive semi-definite in 1800 of 1800.

The ``q_1`` terms are kept even though ``q_1`` vanishes at the centre. They cost nothing, they
make ``\mathbb{D}_s`` correct for *any* origin — the bracket depends only on differences
``\beta(x) - \beta(x')``, so the origin is free — and it is that freedom which makes
[`metric_derivative`](@ref) analytic: the centre may be frozen while ``\hat{u}`` moves, and
``\partial \bar\beta / \partial \hat{u}`` never appears.

# Where the collapse would break

Three hypotheses, none of them cosmetic. ``Q`` must be **polynomial** in ``z`` — it fails for
the true Landau kernel ``|z|^{-3} Q_2(z)``; ``\kappa`` must **factorise**; and ``d\mu(x')``
must **not depend on** ``x``. The Grad-Shafranov weight ``d\mu = dr \, dz / r`` is harmless
precisely because it is of the third kind: it is absorbed into the quadrature weights and
never sees the outer point. That is why `density` is an explicit field of this type rather
than an assumption — a measure is either admissible or it is not, and the type says which one
was used.

# The entropy enters only through `M`

``M`` is fixed by the entropy density through `eq:M-condition`, ``M \, \partial_y^2 s = 1``,
so the manuscript's three cases are three mobilities:

| ``s(x, y)`` | ``M`` | `mobility` |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ``y^2/2`` (§5.4, reduced Euler) | ``1`` | `1` — the default |
| ``y \log y`` (§5.4, Gibbs) | ``y`` | `(x, u) -> u`, `mobility_derivative = (x, u) -> 1` |
| ``y^2 / 2(Cr^2+D)`` (§5.5, Grad-Shafranov) | ``Cr^2 + D`` | `(x, u) -> C*x[1]^2 + D`, `mobility_derivative = 0` |

`eq:M-condition` also requires ``M > 0``, which is what makes ``\kappa`` a positive kernel;
nothing here enforces it, and a mobility that changes sign gives a bracket that is not
positive semi-definite, which [`ispositive_semidefinite`](@ref) will say.

The other half of the entropy, ``\partial_x \partial_y s``, does **not** appear: it enters
``\delta S / \delta u``, which is the flow's business, not the bracket's. What the bracket
contracts against is an arbitrary vector, and the manuscript's

```math
\mathbb{F}_s(u; x) = \int_\Omega Q_2 \big( \nabla \phi(x) - \nabla \phi(x') \big) \,
    w(x') \, d\mu' , \qquad w = M \nabla \frac{\delta S}{\delta u}
    = \nabla u + M \, \partial_x \partial_y s ,
```

is the ``G = S`` case of [`metric_apply`](@ref), where the second equality is `eq:M-condition`
again.

A `mobility` given as a function must be given its derivative ``\partial M / \partial u`` as
`mobility_derivative` — `0` where, as in §5.5, ``M`` depends on ``x`` alone. It is not
differenced silently, for the same reason a general nonlinear generating field is refused by
[`DoubleBracket`](@ref): what makes the Jacobian of a metriplectic flow analytic is exactly
that this derivative is known. `φ̂` and `Λ` are the two forms of the generating field
documented there.

A §5.5 note that is easy to lose: because ``M`` is there independent of
``u``, ``\mathbb{G}`` is *quadratic* in ``\hat{u}`` and ``\partial S / \partial \hat{u}`` is
*linear*, so the dissipative residual is an exact **cubic polynomial** in the degrees of
freedom. Its Jacobian is analytic and cheap, and finite differences have no business being
used for it.
