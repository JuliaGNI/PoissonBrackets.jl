# The mixed two-field formulation of the implicit methods.
#
# The dense formulation solves N equations in the state alone, and its Newton matrix is dense
# because `poisson_matrix` is `Minv * K(u) * Minv` with a dense inverse mass matrix -- see
# `kernel_operator`. Writing the equations of motion as staged solves instead,
#
#     M v      = ∂H/∂u                    (v is the "momentum" M⁻¹ ∂H/∂u)
#     M du/dt  = K(u) v
#
# never forms that sandwich. Eliminating the intermediate leaves 2N equations in (y, v) whose
# Jacobian is built from M, K, ∂(Kv)/∂u and ∂²H -- all banded with circular bandwidth p, and
# all with a sparsity pattern fixed for the whole run, which is what lets the linear solver
# reuse one ordering and symbolic factorization.
#
# It is not always the better trade: 2N unknowns against N, so the dense form wins while N is
# small. Measured crossover is around N = 130; `formulation = :dense` remains the default.

The number of unknowns the mixed formulation of `method` uses, for a state of length `N`.

`2N` for [`ImplicitMidpoint`](@ref): the state and one auxiliary. The other implicit methods
are not supported — [`AverageVectorField`](@ref) needs one auxiliary per quadrature node and
the discrete-gradient methods carry a rank-one term in `∂ḡ/∂y` that would have to be bordered
— and say so rather than silently producing a wrong system.

would otherwise *insert* it, reallocating and silently changing the pattern the linear solver's

    mixed_row_scale(space)

The factor the first residual block is multiplied by, `1 / ‖M‖∞`.

Without it the two blocks of the mixed residual have incommensurable scales. `M (y - uⁿ)`
carries a factor of the mass matrix, whose row sums are the cell width `h = L/N`, while
`M v - ∂H/∂u` has the scale of the gradient and does not shrink with `N` at all. A single
absolute `f_abstol` then cannot serve both: calibrating it for the first block makes the second
unreachable, which at `N = 1024` showed up as the solver spinning to its iteration cap on a
step it had in fact solved.

Scaling the *equation* rather than the tolerance fixes this, and it is applied **uniformly** to
both row blocks. That distinction matters: scaling the blocks by different factors changes the
conditioning, and scaling only the first (as an earlier version did) made `cond(J)` 200 to
1700 times worse. A uniform factor multiplies the whole system, so the condition number and the
Newton step are both exactly unchanged, and only the residual's magnitude moves — which is all
the convergence test needs.

The residual of the mixed formulation of `method` at the stacked unknown `z = [y; v]`.

For [`ImplicitMidpoint`](@ref), with `ū = (uⁿ + y)/2` and `σ` from
[`mixed_row_scale`](@ref):

```

`residual!` up to the scaling — the two describe the same step, and the tests hold them

`σ` multiplies the whole system, residual and Jacobian alike, so both the Newton step and the
condition number are unchanged by it; see [`mixed_row_scale`](@ref).

`∂(K(ū)v)/∂ū` is [`kernel_directional`](@ref), which the bracket already provides and which is
independent of `ū` because the block is linear in it. Every entry is banded, so this is where
the mixed formulation earns its keep: the dense `residual_jacobian!` forms
`Minv * K * Minv * ∂²H`, two dense `N × N` products per assembly.
