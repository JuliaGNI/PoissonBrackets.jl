    DiscreteBracket{T}

A discrete Poisson bracket, i.e. a matrix-valued function ``\mathbb{P}(\hat{u})`` through
which the bracket of two functions of the degrees of freedom is

```math
\{A, B\}_d = \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial A}{\partial \hat{u}_i} \,
             \mathbb{P}_{ij} (\hat{u}) \, \frac{\partial B}{\partial \hat{u}_j} .
```

The interface is [`poisson_matrix`](@ref), [`poisson_apply`](@ref) and
[`poisson_derivative`](@ref); everything else — antisymmetry, the Jacobiator, the rank and
the Casimirs — follows from those and is written once.

# What is and is not guaranteed

Antisymmetry is a property of how the bracket is *assembled*, and every bracket here is
built in explicitly skew-symmetrised form, so it holds to the last bit for any quadrature
and any mesh. The Jacobi identity is not: it is a genuine question about the discretisation,
and the answer differs from one bracket to the next.

| bracket | antisymmetric | Jacobi |
|:--|:--|:--|
| [`ConstantBracket`](@ref) | yes | yes, automatically — a constant antisymmetric bracket satisfies it |
| [`GaugedBracket`](@ref) | yes | yes, by the theorem it is built on |
| [`MiuraBracket`](@ref) | yes | yes, being a pushforward of a Poisson bracket |
| [`AffineBracket`](@ref) | yes | **no** — and this is a result, not a defect |

The failure of [`AffineBracket`](@ref) is the point of the KdV manuscript: the second
Hamiltonian structure of KdV is the Virasoro algebra, so the Jacobi identity would require
the discrete coefficients to close into a Lie algebra, a quadratic condition on the basis
that no choice of quadrature can deliver. The residual is of order one and flat under
refinement.

comparable across resolutions.

The normalisation is what makes the quantity worth reporting. A raw residual can be driven
to zero by any change that merely shrinks the bracket, and a residual normalised by
``\max|\mathbb{P}|^2`` by any change that makes it blow up; dividing by the largest term
actually formed is neither.

A bracket linear in the field, ``\mathbb{J}_{ij}(u) = \sum_m c_{ij}^m u_m``, is Poisson if
and only if the ``c_{ij}^m`` are the structure constants of a Lie algebra, which is exactly
this condition.

# Choosing a control

Do **not** validate a routine like this against ``\mathfrak{so}(3)``. It lies inside the
six-parameter family ``c_{ij}^k = \epsilon_{ijl} n^{lk}`` with ``n`` symmetric — Bianchi
class A — *every* member of which satisfies the Jacobi identity, and the perturbations one
naturally reaches for stay inside it: rescaling a generator, or rescaling a single structure
constant, both leave ``n`` symmetric and diagonal. So ``\mathfrak{so}(3)`` keeps passing
after it has apparently been broken, and passing tells you nothing.

It is *not* the case that antisymmetry alone forces Jacobi in three dimensions — a general
antisymmetric `c` has nine parameters against this family's six, and random ones fail
comfortably. The degeneracy is specific to the family, not to the dimension. (The Python
prototypes state the broader claim; it is an erratum, recorded in `docs/src/verification.md`.)

Use ``\mathfrak{se}(3)`` as the positive control, and a random antisymmetric `c` in
dimension five as the negative one.

## Constant bracket

@doc raw"""
    ConstantBracket(P)
    ConstantBracket(space, K)

A bracket whose structure matrix does not depend on the field,
``\mathbb{P}(\hat{u}) = \mathbb{P}``.

The second form sandwiches a weak-form operator between two inverse mass matrices,
``\mathbb{P} = \mathbb{M}^{-1} \mathbb{K} \mathbb{M}^{-1}``, which is what the discrete
functional derivative produces, and skew-symmetrises `K` on the way in.

Such a bracket is **automatically Poisson**: the Jacobi identity for a constant bracket
follows from antisymmetry alone, every derivative in the Jacobiator being zero. This is why
the first KdV structure survives discretisation intact where the second does not.

## Affine bracket

@doc raw"""
    AffineBracket(space, scale, Ψ, K0)

A bracket whose structure matrix is affine in the field,

```math
\mathbb{P}(\hat{u}) = \mathbb{M}^{-1}
    \left( \mathbb{K}_0 + \mathbb{K}^\rho (\hat{u}) \right) \mathbb{M}^{-1} ,
```

with `K0` a constant antisymmetric block and

```math
\mathbb{K}^\rho_{kl} (\hat{u}) = \sigma \int_\Omega \rho_h
    \left( \phi_k \partial_x \phi_l - \phi_l \partial_x \phi_k \right) dx
```

the part of transport type, ``\sigma (\rho \partial_x + \partial_x \rho)`` in weak form.
Both blocks are skew-symmetrised on the way in, so the assembled matrix is antisymmetric
identically.

The density is given by its own tabulation `Ψ`, with ``\rho_h = \Psi^T \hat{u}`` at the
quadrature points, which keeps the bracket *linear* in ``\hat{u}`` and so lets both the
matrix-free product and the Jacobian of the flow be written in closed form:

  - for the second KdV bracket, ``4u \partial_x + 2u_x = 2(u \partial_x + \partial_x u)``,
    so `scale` is `2` and ``\Psi = \Phi_0``, the density being ``u_h`` itself;
  - for the second Camassa-Holm bracket, ``m \partial_x + \partial_x m``, `scale` is `1`
    and ``\Psi = \Phi_0 - \Phi_2``, the density being ``m_h = u_h - u_h''``.

# Why the skew-symmetrised form

The unsymmetrised assembly ``\int (4 u_h \phi_k \partial_x \phi_l + 2 \partial_x u_h \phi_k
\phi_l)`` is the same matrix in exact arithmetic — the term ``2 \partial_x u_h \phi_k
\phi_l`` is symmetric in ``k \leftrightarrow l`` and drops out of the skew part, while
integrating it by parts supplies the rest. But it is antisymmetric only if the quadrature
integrates the total derivative ``\partial_x (u_h \phi_k \phi_l)``, of degree ``3p-1``,
exactly. Written as above, antisymmetry holds identically at any `nq` and on any mesh, and
the exact conservation of the generating Hamiltonian holds with it. That is the whole
practical content of the skew-symmetrisation, and it is not a cosmetic rearrangement.

Neither of these brackets satisfies the Jacobi identity; see [`DiscreteBracket`](@ref).

## Gauged bracket

@doc raw"""
    GaugedBracket(K, g, dg)

The bracket of the discretisation theorem for Lie-Poisson brackets,

```math
\mathbb{J}_{ij} (u) = g_i (u_i) \, \mathbb{K}_{ij} \, g_j (u_j)
\qquad \text{(no sum over \$i\$ and \$j\$)} ,
```

with ``\mathbb{K}`` a **constant** antisymmetric matrix and ``g`` a smooth function of the
**single** variable ``u_i``.

Such a bracket is Poisson on any domain where `g` is defined. Antisymmetry is immediate, and
the Jacobi identity holds because the bracket is the pullback of the constant bracket
``\mathbb{K}`` under a change of variables that acts coordinate by coordinate — a
transformation of a Poisson bracket is again a Poisson bracket.

# Both hypotheses are sharp

Neither can be relaxed. If ``\mathbb{K}`` depends on ``u``, or if ``g_i`` depends on any
variable other than ``u_i``, the Jacobi identity fails; the test suite exhibits both
failures rather than merely asserting the theorem.

The Burgers bracket is the case ``g(u) = \sqrt{u}``, which requires ``u > 0``. Its Casimirs
are ``C_n = \sum_i n_i G_i(u_i)`` with ``G' = 1/g`` and ``n`` in the kernel of
``\mathbb{K}``; for the square root, ``G(u) = 2\sqrt{u}``.

`dg` is ``g'``, needed for the Jacobiator and for the Jacobian of the flow.

## Miura bracket

@doc raw"""
    MiuraBracket(space, v̂, bracket1)

The pushforward of the first bracket along the Miura map, evaluated at the mKdV field `v̂`,

```math
\mathbb{P}^2_{\mathrm{M}} (\hat{v}) = \mathbb{L}(\hat{v}) \; \mathbb{P}^1 \;
                                      \mathbb{L}(\hat{v})^T ,
\qquad
\mathbb{L}(\hat{v}) = -\mathbb{M}^{-1} \big( 2\mathbb{B}(\hat{v}) + S \big) ,
\qquad
\mathbb{B}_{kl} = \int_\Omega v_h \phi_k \phi_l \, dx ,
```

the discrete counterpart of the Miura factorisation

```math
(2v + \partial_x) \, \partial_x \, (2v - \partial_x) = -4u\partial_x - 2u_x - \partial_x^3
```

under ``u = -(v^2 + v_x)``. The overall sign of ``\mathbb{L}`` cancels in
``\mathbb{L}\mathbb{P}^1\mathbb{L}^T``, so the assembled bracket is what it always was; it
is the *chart* that carries the sign, and `miura_invert` and the chain rule below need the
true Jacobian.

Antisymmetry is a one-line consequence of ``\mathbb{B}^T = \mathbb{B}`` and ``S^T = -S``,
and the Jacobi identity of the facts that ``\mathbb{P}^1`` is constant and antisymmetric and
``\mathbb{L}`` invertible. The normalised Jacobiator is at round-off at every resolution,
against ``\approx 0.42`` flat for the Galerkin [`kdv_bracket_2`](@ref).

# The price is locality

Both brackets have the form ``\mathbb{M}^{-1}\mathbb{K}\mathbb{M}^{-1}``, but the Galerkin
``\mathbb{K}`` is a single local assembly, banded with the bandwidth of the basis, whereas

```math
\mathbb{K}_{\mathrm{M}} = \big( 2\mathbb{B} + S \big) \, \mathbb{M}^{-1} S \, \mathbb{M}^{-1}
                          \, \big( 2\mathbb{B} - S \big)
```

carries **two interior inverse mass matrices** and is dense: for `N = 24` cubic splines the
circular bandwidth is 3 for the Galerkin assembly and 12, the maximum, for
``\mathbb{K}_{\mathrm{M}}``. That nonlocality is not an artefact to be optimised away — it is
what the Jacobi identity costs.

# It is a bracket on v-space

``\mathbb{P}^2_{\mathrm{M}}`` is a function of ``\hat{v}``, so writing it as a structure on
``u``-space presupposes ``\mathcal{M}_h^{-1}``, which is undefined on most of
``\mathbb{R}^N``; see [`miura_invert`](@ref) and [`hill_lambda0`](@ref). In practice one does
not form this matrix at all but integrates [`MiuraSystem`](@ref) in the ``\hat{v}`` chart,
where the bracket is the constant ``\mathbb{P}^1``.

See also [`miura_derivative`](@ref) for ``\mathbb{L}`` and [`miura_map`](@ref) for
``\mathcal{M}_h``.

The Jacobian of the discrete Miura map,
``\mathbb{L}(\hat{v}) = \mathbb{M}^{-1}(2\mathbb{B}(\hat{v}) + S)``, the discretisation of
``\mathcal{M}' = 2v + \partial_x``.

Its transpose ``\mathbb{L}^T = (2\mathbb{B} - S)\mathbb{M}^{-1}`` discretises the adjoint

# Where it degenerates, and how sharply that is known

For the *differential* operator the statement is exact: ``\ker(2v + \partial_x)`` is spanned
by ``\exp(-2\int v)``, which is periodic precisely on ``\int_\Omega v \, dx = 0``. For the
assembled ``\mathbb{M}^{-1}(2\mathbb{B} + S)`` it is **evidence rather than proof** — the
condition number is around ``10^9`` on that set and below ``10^2`` away from it — and the
discrete critical set need not coincide with the continuous one.

What *is* exact here is a statement in the other direction, and it is the one that matters in
practice: ``\int_\Omega v_h \, dx`` is an exact Casimir of ``\mathbb{P}^1`` in this chart
(see [`miura_casimir`](@ref)), so the Miura flow **cannot reach** ``\int_\Omega v_h = 0``
from initial data off it, at any resolution and for any step lying in the range of
``\mathbb{P}^1``. The near-degeneracy is therefore not something a run can wander into; it
has to be posed there.

    miura_map(space, v̂, λ = 0)

The discrete Miura map with spectral parameter,
``\hat{u} = \mathcal{M}_h^\lambda(\hat{v})``, i.e. the ``L^2`` projection of
``-(v_h^2 + v_{h,x}) - \lambda``. The sign is the one that makes the map carry the mKdV flow
``v_t = 6v^2v_x - v_{xxx}`` to ``u_t + 6uu_x + u_{xxx} = 0``.

# What λ is for

At ``\lambda = 0`` the image is the half-space ``C_{0,d} \le 0`` and, sharply, the fields
whose Hill operator is positive definite — which excludes every standard KdV example. The
parameter removes that restriction, and it is not an ad-hoc shift: the Riccati substitution
``v = \psi_x/\psi`` turns ``u = -(v^2 + v_x) - \lambda`` into

```math
\left( -\partial_x^2 - u_h \right) \psi = \lambda \psi ,
```

so **λ is an eigenvalue parameter of the very Hill operator that decides invertibility**. A
real periodic preimage exists exactly when ``\lambda`` lies at or below the bottom of the
spectrum,

```math
\lambda < \lambda_0 \left( -\partial_x^2 - u_h \right) ,
```

which for any ``\hat{u}`` whatever can be arranged by taking ``\lambda`` negative enough.
[`miura_lambda`](@ref) returns such a value. At ``\lambda = 0`` the condition reduces to
``\lambda_0 > 0``, the criterion of [`hill_lambda0`](@ref).

# What it costs

``\mathbb{L}`` does not see a constant, so [`miura_derivative`](@ref) and hence
[`MiuraBracket`](@ref) are **unchanged**. What changes is which bracket the pushforward is:

```math
\mathbb{L} \mathbb{P}^1 \mathbb{L}^T = \mathbb{P}^2 - 4\lambda \mathbb{P}^1 ,
```

a member of the bi-Hamiltonian *pencil* rather than ``\mathbb{P}^2`` itself. It is exactly
Poisson for every ``\lambda``, by the same one-line argument. On the ``u`` side the extra
``-4\lambda\mathbb{P}^1 \partial H_2/\partial\hat{u}`` is a constant-speed translation, so
the trajectory is the KdV solution in a uniformly moving frame and all three invariants are
untouched — ``H_2`` and ``C_{0}`` because the drift is generated by them, ``H_1`` because
``\{H_1,H_2\}_1 = 0``.

# The mass identity, and the half-space it used to confine the image to

Pairing with the partition of unity gives the exact identity

```math
C_{0,d} = \int_\Omega u_h \, dx
        = -\int_\Omega \big( v_h^2 + \partial_x v_h \big) \, dx - \lambda L
        = -\int_\Omega v_h^2 \, dx - \lambda L ,
```

so at ``\lambda = 0`` the image lies in the half-space of **non-positive mass**,
``C_{0,d} \le 0``, meeting ``C_{0,d} = 0`` only at ``v_h \equiv 0``. A negative ``\lambda``
moves that half-space up by ``-\lambda L`` and is what lets any mass be reached.

!!! note "The sign convention never decided this"
    In the older ``u_t = 6uu_x - u_{xxx}`` convention the map was ``u = v^2 + v_x`` and the
    image was the *non-negative* half-space, with the solitons excluded for being
    depressions. Flipping to elevations flips the half-space with them, and they are excluded
    again — now for being positive. The obstruction was never a matter of signs: a soliton is
    by construction a reflectionless potential *with* a bound state, and the ``\lambda = 0``
    chart covers exactly the fields whose Hill operator has none. What lifts the restriction
    is ``\lambda``, because it moves the spectral threshold rather than relabelling it.

because its image lies in ``C_{0,d} \le 0`` (see [`miura_map`](@ref)), and sharply because the
discrete Hill operator must be positive definite ([`hill_lambda0`](@ref)). Where a preimage
exists there are two — the two Floquet solutions of ``\psi'' = (-u - \lambda)\psi``, with
opposite signs of ``\int_\Omega v`` — and `seed` selects the branch.

The `λ` argument is what makes the map surjective in practice: a preimage exists exactly when
``\lambda < `` [`hill_lambda0`](@ref)`(space, û)`, which can always be arranged.
[`miura_lambda`](@ref) picks such a value. Returning `nothing` rather than throwing is
