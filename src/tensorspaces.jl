The tensor-product B-spline space
``\Phi_{i_1 \dots i_D}(x) = \prod_{d} \phi^{(d)}_{i_d}(x_d)`` on the box
``\Omega = \Omega_1 \times \dots \times \Omega_D``, a thin wrapper around the assembly tables
of SimpleSplines.

```jldoctest
julia> s = TensorSplineSpace((8, 8), 3);

julia> nbasis(s), degree(s)
(64, (3, 3))
```

Degree, mesh, domain and boundary condition are **per axis**, and all three are reached
through the one dispatching constructor `BSplineBasis(mesh, p, bc)`: `Periodic()` gives the
periodic torus, `Dirichlet()` the recombined homogeneous-Dirichlet basis, `Free()` the plain
clamped one. A scalar `p`, `bc` or `L` is applied to every axis; a `D`-tuple gives one entry
per axis. To impose *different* conditions at the two ends of a single axis, build that
axis's basis yourself and pass the bases — `(Dirichlet(), Neumann())` as `bc` on a
two-dimensional space is read as one condition per axis, not as the two ends of one.

# Coefficients are flat vectors

Every bracket, Hamiltonian, flow and integrator in this package is written against
[`DiscreteSpace`](@ref) and takes a coefficient **vector** of length ``N = \prod_d N_d``.
That convention is kept here, and the array shape `size(space)` that SimpleSplines uses
appears only where it must — [`evaluate`](@ref) reshapes into it, and `KroneckerMass`
reshapes on its own. The flattening runs the **first axis fastest**, which is
`LinearIndices(basis(space))`, `vec` of a `quadrature_sample` array, and the convention that
makes the assembled mass matrix `kron(M_D, …, M_1)`. All three agree, and none of the code
below would be correct if they did not.

# What generalises, and what does not

The abstract interface is answered unchanged, so [`project`](@ref), [`project!`](@ref),
[`basis_integrals`](@ref) and `field` are the generic implementations of `spaces.jl` running
on a two- or three-dimensional space. The one notion that has no scalar meaning here is the
derivative order: ``\partial_1 \phi`` and ``\partial_2 \phi`` are different tables, so
`basis_values(space, d)` takes a **per-axis multi-index** `d::NTuple{D,Int}`, and the scalar
form is accepted only for `d = 0` and rejected with a message naming the tuple otherwise.
`derivative_matrix` and `stiffness_matrix` follow: the first takes the axis `k` it
differentiates along, and the second is ``\int_\Omega \nabla \phi_k \cdot \nabla \phi_l``,
the sum over the axes. [`domainlength`](@ref) returns the per-axis tuple rather than a
scalar; the scalar that does exist is [`domainvolume`](@ref).

# Storage

The tabulation ``\Phi_d`` is the sparse Kronecker product of the ``D`` one-dimensional
tables, formed on first use and memoised, as are the [`mixed_matrix`](@ref) constants built
from it. It is ``N \times Q`` with ``\prod_d (p_d+1)`` nonzeros per column — at ``64^2``
cubic cells that is 1.6 million entries, some 26 MB per derivative multi-index, and the
three tables a gradient assembly needs are the working set. This is the price of making the
promise of [`DiscreteSpace`](@ref) literally true in ``D`` dimensions: a matrix
``\int_\Omega f \, D^a \phi_k \, D^b \phi_l`` is still
``\Phi_a \, \mathrm{diag}(f \odot w) \, \Phi_b^T`` with a *non-separable* ``f``, which no
sequence of one-dimensional contractions gives.

The mass matrix is the exception and is never inverted densely: `mass_factorization` returns
the `KroneckerMass` of SimpleSplines, whose solve is ``D`` one-dimensional solves applied
along each axis. See [`inverse_mass_matrix`](@ref) for what the dense form costs and why it
is not stored.

`d` is a **per-axis multi-index**: `(1,0)` is ``\partial_1``, `(0,1)` is ``\partial_2``,

quadratures tabulated exist, i.e. `d[k] ≤ dmax[k]`.

The scalar form is accepted only for `d = 0`, where the multi-index is unambiguous. A scalar
`d ≥ 1` is **rejected**: on more than one axis there is no such thing as "the `d`-th
derivative", and silently choosing an axis — or reading the scalar as a total order, which

a metric bracket assembles, and the one operator this space exists for. It is the sum of
``D^2`` scalar-weighted matrices, each [`weighted_matrix`](@ref) against one component of the
coefficient.

The coefficient may be given as

  - a constant `D×D` matrix of numbers, in which case the ``D^2`` constant
    [`mixed_matrix`](@ref) blocks are reused and only the nonzero components are touched;
  - a `D×D` matrix whose `[k,l]` entry is a vector of samples at `quadrature_nodes` —
    the canonical form, and the one a moment expansion produces component by component;
  - a vector of `D×D` matrices, one per quadrature point;
  - a function of a `D`-tuple of coordinates returning a `D×D` matrix.

The component form has to be built element by element. `[a b; c d]` with vector entries
*concatenates* them into one long matrix of numbers instead of a `D×D` matrix of vectors:

``v^T \mathbb{A} v = \int (\nabla v_h)^T \mathbb{D} \, \nabla v_h``. Neither is imposed here;
