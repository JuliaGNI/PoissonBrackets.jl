#
# Dirac reduction of a Poisson tensor onto a constraint surface.
#
# Split the coordinates into a coarse block V1 (`keep`) and a constrained block V2 (`con`),
# and impose u_a = 0 for a in V2. When the constraint matrix C = J22 is invertible -- the
# constraints are SECOND CLASS -- the Dirac bracket
#
#     J*_ij = J_ij - J_ia (C^-1)_ab J_bj
#
# has the constraints as Casimirs, and its restriction to V1 is the Schur complement
# Jhat = J11 - J12 J22^-1 J21.
#
# Everything here is written once and generically in the element type. With `Rational{BigInt}`
# the identities come out exactly -- `iszero`, not "below 1e-12" -- and with `Float64` the same
# code runs the refinement studies. The Python prototypes carried an exact and a
# floating-point copy of each of these routines; keeping one is what stops the two drifting
# apart, which is a failure mode those prototypes actually recorded.
#
# SIGN CONVENTION OF THE JACOBIATOR. `jacobiator` uses the convention of `jacobi_residual`,
# sum_l (J_il d_l J_jk + cyclic), which for antisymmetric J is the negative of the form used
# in the Python prototypes. Every claim these tools serve is either "this vanishes" or "these
# two agree", so a global sign is invisible to all of them -- but it is worth knowing when
# comparing intermediate numbers against the Python.
#
# This was a file-level `@doc` block attached to no binding, which Documenter drops without a
# word: none of it reached the manual. The prose now lives in `docs/src/dirac.md`, where it is
# rendered; the comment stays so that a reader of the source has the definition to hand.

A maximal subset `S ⊆ con` on which the constraint matrix ``\mathbb{J}[S,S]`` is invertible,

The diagonal of an antisymmetric matrix vanishes, so constrained directions are only useful
in **pairs**: an odd-sized block is always singular. The set is therefore grown two indices
at a time, greedily, while the block stays nonsingular. That parity is not a technicality —
it is why a constrained block of odd dimension can never be fully second class, and it is
one of the two obstructions the Dirac note raises before any computation is done.
