    MetricBracket{T}

A discrete metric bracket, i.e. a matrix-valued function ``\mathbb{G}(\hat{u})`` through
which the symmetric bracket of two functions of the degrees of freedom is

```math
(A, B)_d = \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial A}{\partial \hat{u}_i} \,
           \mathbb{G}_{ij} (\hat{u}) \, \frac{\partial B}{\partial \hat{u}_j} .
```

This is the symmetric half of a metriplectic structure and the mirror image of
[`DiscreteBracket`](@ref). The interface is [`metric_matrix`](@ref), [`metric_apply`](@ref)
and [`metric_derivative`](@ref); [`issymmetric`](@ref), [`ispositive_semidefinite`](@ref) and
the three-argument [`degeneracy_residual`](@ref) follow from those and are written once.

The *two*-argument `degeneracy_residual` is the one exception, and it needs two hooks more:
[`space`](@ref), and the internal `_generator(b, û)` below. It has to, because supplying the
gradient from the bracket means knowing where the bracket keeps it. A bracket that implements
only the three interface methods is not defective — it simply passes its gradient explicitly
and uses the three-argument form.

# What is and is not guaranteed

Symmetry and positive semi-definiteness are properties of how the bracket is *assembled*.
Both brackets here are built in explicitly symmetric form from a pointwise Gram matrix, so
both hold for any quadrature and any mesh.

The degeneracy is the one that has content. A metric bracket is required to satisfy
``(A, H)_d = 0`` for every ``A``, i.e. ``\mathbb{G} \, \partial H / \partial \hat{u} = 0``,
and it is *that* which makes ``\dot{H} = 0`` a property of the bracket rather than of the
quadrature or the mesh. [`degeneracy_residual`](@ref) measures it.

It is not a property of the *integrator*, and does not become one. Whether a one-step method
holds ``H`` exactly is a separate question about the method: the midpoint rule does, because a
quadratic ``H`` satisfies ``H(y) - H(x) = \nabla H(\bar{u}) \cdot (y - x)`` exactly and the
increment lies in the range of ``\mathbb{G}(\bar{u})``. Explicit Euler's increment lies in the
range of ``\mathbb{G}(\hat{u}^n)`` just as squarely and still moves ``H`` by
``O(\Delta t^2)``. See [`MetriplecticFlow`](@ref).

| bracket | symmetric | positive semi-definite | degenerate on ``H`` |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| [`DoubleBracket`](@ref) | yes, ``\mathbb{D} = X_h \otimes X_h`` is | yes, a pointwise Gram matrix | yes — ``X_h \cdot \nabla h = 0`` pointwise, so it holds at the quadrature level |
| [`ProjectorBracket`](@ref) | yes, a rank-one correction to ``\mathbb{M}^{-1}`` | yes, by Cauchy-Schwarz in the ``\mathbb{M}``-inner product | yes, exactly — ``\Pi_H \phi = 0`` by construction |

Both brackets are *generated* by the Hamiltonian: the double bracket by the vector field of
``\delta H / \delta u`` and the projector bracket by the direction it projects out. The
coefficients of ``\delta H / \delta u`` are what the internal hook `_generator(b, û)` returns,
and the two-argument [`degeneracy_residual`](@ref) uses it to check the defining property
without being told the Hamiltonian a second time.

[`metric_derivative`](@ref) already contracted against one direction.

This is the symmetric-half counterpart of [`bracket_directional`](@ref) and exists for the
same reason. Differentiating ``\mathbb{G}(\hat{u}) \, \partial S/\partial \hat{u}`` produces
one term from the entropy and one from the bracket, and this is the second — the only part of
``\partial \mathbb{G}/\partial \hat{u}`` a Newton iteration ever needs. The full tensor is
``O(N^3)`` in storage and costs ``N`` sandwiches to build, which is not affordable inside a
time loop; contracting first replaces each sandwich by a single mass solve against the one
direction that is actually wanted.

The generic method here does form the tensor, so a bracket that defines only the three
interface methods still has a correct Jacobian. Every bracket in the package overrides it: a
prescribed generating field makes it identically zero, and the ``\Lambda``-generated forms are
closed or matrix-free.

The tolerance is relative to the largest eigenvalue because the quantity being tested is a

instead. Both brackets here are semi-definite by construction and genuinely singular — the
Hamiltonian is in the kernel — so the smallest eigenvalue is zero to round-off rather than

with `g` the gradient ``\partial H / \partial \hat{u}`` of the Hamiltonian the bracket is
generated by. The two-argument form supplies that gradient from the bracket itself, which is
``\mathbb{M} \hat{h}`` for the ``\hat{h}`` the bracket stores.

The normalisation is the same one [`jacobi_residual`](@ref) uses and is there for the same
reason: a raw residual can be driven to zero by any change that merely shrinks the bracket,
and the denominator here is the largest single product that can enter the sum.

This is the check that catches a sign error in ``Q_2``. Symmetry and positive
semi-definiteness survive one — ``X \otimes X`` is a Gram matrix whichever way ``X`` is
signed — and it is only the degeneracy that notices that the coefficient is no longer built
on the ``\perp`` of the gradient it is contracted against.

Both brackets store it either as a fixed vector or as the matrix ``\Lambda`` of the linear

also exactly the two for which [`metric_derivative`](@ref) is analytic.

`mass_matrix` is a stored constant on a `SplineSpace` and a `LagrangeSpace`, so the generic
method below costs nothing there. On a [`TensorSplineSpace`](@ref) it is not stored: the matrix
is the Kronecker product of the per-axis factors, it is rebuilt on every call, and
[`ProjectorBracket`](@ref) needs ``\mathbb{M} \hat{\phi}`` on every single contraction. The
`KroneckerMass` forms the same product as ``D`` one-dimensional applications without
assembling anything, which is what keeps [`metric_apply`](@ref) independent of the mesh in
cost as well as in algebra.

## Double bracket

@doc raw"""
    DoubleBracket(space, ĥ)
    DoubleBracket(space, Λ)

The metric double bracket of a two-dimensional field,

```math
(F, G) = \int_\Omega
    \left[ \frac{\delta F}{\delta u}, h \right]_J
    \left[ \frac{\delta G}{\delta u}, h \right]_J dx ,
\qquad [f, g]_J = \partial_1 f \, \partial_2 g - \partial_2 f \, \partial_1 g ,
```

with ``h = \delta H / \delta u``. Since ``[f, h]_J = \nabla f \cdot X_h`` with the
Hamiltonian vector field ``X_h = (\partial_2 h, -\partial_1 h)``, the bracket is

```math
(F, G) = \int_\Omega \nabla \frac{\delta F}{\delta u} \cdot
         \left( X_h \otimes X_h \right) \nabla \frac{\delta G}{\delta u} \, dx ,
```

a variable-**tensor**-coefficient stiffness matrix — [`tensor_weighted_matrix`](@ref) with
``\mathbb{D} = X_h \otimes X_h`` — sandwiched between two inverse mass matrices, which is
what the discrete functional derivative produces. The flow it generates is
``\partial_t u = \nabla \cdot (X_h \otimes X_h \, \nabla u)``, diffusion along the contours
of ``h`` and none across them.

The coefficient is written as the outer product rather than as
``Q_2(\nabla h) = |\nabla h|^2 \mathbb{I} - \nabla h \otimes \nabla h``, which in two
dimensions is the same matrix exactly — `scripts/verify_metric_collapse.jl` checks the
identity over five decades of scale. The outer product is the form that is manifestly a Gram
matrix, hence manifestly positive semi-definite, and it is the ``\perp`` in it that carries
the degeneracy: ``X_h \cdot \nabla h = \partial_2 h \, \partial_1 h - \partial_1 h \,
\partial_2 h`` vanishes *pointwise*, so ``\mathbb{G} \, \partial H / \partial \hat{u} = 0``
holds at the quadrature level and not merely in the continuum.

# The two forms of `h`

`ĥ` is a coefficient vector when ``h`` is prescribed, and `Λ` is the matrix of the linear map
``\hat{h} = \Lambda \hat{u}`` when it is not. The manuscript's two-dimensional examples need
exactly these: ``h = \cos^2 x_1 \sin^2 x_2`` fixed for parallel diffusion, and
``\hat{\psi} = \mathbb{K}^{-1} \mathbb{M} \hat{\omega}`` from the elliptic solve for reduced
Euler. Both make [`metric_derivative`](@ref) analytic; a general nonlinear ``h`` would not,
and is not accepted rather than being differenced silently.

## Projector bracket

@doc raw"""
    ProjectorBracket(space, φ̂)
    ProjectorBracket(space, Λ)

The metric bracket built from the ``L^2`` projector orthogonal to ``\phi = \delta H /
\delta u``,

```math
(F, G) = \left( \frac{\delta F}{\delta u}, \, \Pi_H \frac{\delta G}{\delta u} \right)_{L^2} ,
\qquad
\Pi_H v = v - \frac{(\phi, v)_{L^2}}{\| \phi \|^2_{L^2}} \, \phi .
```

On the degrees of freedom this is a **rank-one correction to the inverse mass matrix**,

```math
\mathbb{G} = \mathbb{M}^{-1}
    - \frac{\hat{\phi} \, \hat{\phi}^T}{\hat{\phi}^T \mathbb{M} \hat{\phi}} ,
```

and needs no quadrature at all: the two inverse mass matrices of the discrete functional
derivative cancel against the ``\mathbb{M}`` of the ``L^2`` product, and what is left is
algebra in ``\hat{\phi}``. [`metric_apply`](@ref) is therefore one mass solve, one mass apply
and two inner products — no quadrature loop, and nothing of size ``N^2`` formed.

Both mass operations go through the space's own operator, `mass_factorization` for the solve
and [`_mass_apply`](@ref) for the product, so neither assembles ``\mathbb{M}``. That is what
makes the cost independent of the mesh in fact and not only in algebra: on a
[`TensorSplineSpace`](@ref) the call allocates 2 400 B at ``N = 25``, 4 576 B at ``N = 64`` and
9 056 B at ``N = 144`` — the vectors it returns, growing like ``N``. Reaching for
`mass_matrix` instead would rebuild the Kronecker product every time, which is 10 640, 29 376
and 66 944 B of that same call.

Positive semi-definiteness is Cauchy-Schwarz in the ``\mathbb{M}``-inner product: with
``v = \mathbb{M}^{-1} c``,

```math
c^T \mathbb{G} c = (v, v)_\mathbb{M}
    - \frac{(\hat{\phi}, v)^2_\mathbb{M}}{(\hat{\phi}, \hat{\phi})_\mathbb{M}} \ge 0 ,
```

with equality exactly on the span of ``\hat{\phi}``. The degeneracy is the same statement
read the other way: ``\mathbb{G} \, \mathbb{M} \hat{\phi} = \hat{\phi} - \hat{\phi} = 0``
identically, in exact arithmetic, at any resolution.

`φ̂` and `Λ` are the two forms of the generating field described under
[`DoubleBracket`](@ref), and the space may be of any dimension — nothing here is
two-dimensional.

The projector ``\Pi_H`` applied to the field with coefficients `v̂`, in coefficients.

``\Pi_H \hat{\phi} = 0`` and ``\Pi_H^2 = \Pi_H``; both are what make the bracket degenerate
on the Hamiltonian and idempotent, and both are properties of this map rather than of the
assembled matrix.

    metric_directional(b::ProjectorBracket, û, v)

Closed form, ``O(N^2)``: contracting the tensor of [`metric_derivative`](@ref) with `v`
collapses every index sum into an inner product,

```math
D_{im} = - \frac{(\hat{\phi} \cdot v) \, \Lambda_{im}
              + \hat{\phi}_i \, (\Lambda^T v)_m}{n}
         + \frac{2 \, (\hat{\phi} \cdot v) \, \hat{\phi}_i \,

\qquad n = \hat{\phi}^T \mathbb{M} \hat{\phi} .
```

Nothing of size ``N^3`` is formed, no quadrature is touched and nothing is assembled — this is
two matrix-vector products and two dot products. It is the one bracket for which contracting
first saves an **order of magnitude** rather than a constant factor, and the saving grows with
``N`` because there is no assembly left to dominate the sandwich it removes.
`scripts/verify_metriplectic_flow.jl` measures the ratio; it is a wall-clock number and is
reported there rather than pinned here, where it would go stale on the next machine.
