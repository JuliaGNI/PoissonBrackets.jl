The invariants of a [`MiuraSystem`](@ref), **reported in ``u``**.

The state is ``\hat{v}``, so the map through [`miura_map`](@ref) comes first and everything
after it is the ordinary KdV computation. This is what lets a `MiuraSystem` be handed to
[`integrate`](@ref) and to the plotting routines alongside the ``u``-chart systems and
compared with them directly.

Note that ``C_{0,d} = \int u_h = -\int v_h^2`` is negative by construction here, and is *not*
a Casimir in this chart — the Casimir of ``\mathbb{P}^1`` in ``\hat{v}`` is
[`miura_casimir`](@ref), ``\int v_h``, which corresponds to nothing in ``u``.

    Trajectory

The record of a run: the output times, the initial values of the invariants, and the
**windowed maxima** of their deviations.

`deviation[k, j]` is the largest ``|I_k - I_k(0)|`` reached *anywhere* inside output window
`j`, not the value at its end.

# Why windowed maxima and not samples

The error of a geometric integrator oscillates with a period of tens of steps. Sampling it
every `stride` steps over a run of millions aliases that oscillation into noise, and the
noise can be an order of magnitude below the true envelope — so a plot built from samples
shows a method conserving an invariant far better than it does. The invariants are therefore
evaluated at *every* step and only the reporting is windowed.

Plot the error of **one** invariant against time, and the initial and final states.

Defined in a package extension: load `CairoMakie` to make them available.

```julia
using PoissonBrackets, CairoMakie
fig = energyplot(trajs, labels; name = :H2)
```

One invariant per figure, and one *family* of vector fields per figure. Putting several
invariants side by side forces a shared axis on quantities whose errors sit orders of
magnitude apart, and putting every run on one axis makes eight curves of four colours where
the comparison that matters is within a family.

The encoding is deliberate and worth keeping if these are adapted: **colour carries the
integrator and line style carries the vector field**, so no series is identified by colour
alone and the figure survives being printed in grey. The palette is Okabe-Ito.

The three-argument method draws a row of panels, one per invariant, each with its own y
axis. It exists for the manuscript's own figure layout; the single-panel method remains the
default for the reason just given.

If the reference value of the invariant vanishes — the mass of the cosine initial condition
does, to round-off — the panel reports the absolute error instead of the relative one, and
says so on the axis.

    sweepplot(dts, series; kwargs...)

The step-size sweep of the backward error analysis, as two stacked panels: the departure of
the respective other Hamiltonian against ``\Delta t``, and its **excess over the
``\Delta t \to 0`` plateau**.

`series` is a vector of `label => values` pairs, one per run, with `values` aligned to `dts`.

Both panels are needed and neither alone will do. On the upper one the curves sit within a
factor of eight of each other and nothing is visible; the dependence on ``\Delta t`` only
appears once each run's own plateau — its value at the smallest step size — is subtracted.
What is then left is the ``O(\Delta t^2)`` of the energy-preserving methods, and *nothing at
all* for the midpoint rule on the first flow, which is the whole point: its error is spatial,
and the time discretisation adds none of its own.

A dotted ``O(\Delta t^2)`` guide is drawn on the lower panel, anchored to the first series
that has a nonzero excess.

    convergenceplot(xs, series; kwargs...)

A refinement study on log-log axes: `series` is a vector of `label => errors` pairs against

Written for the claims that are about a rate *not* being achieved as much as for the ones
where it is. A residual that is flat under refinement — the ``\approx 0.42`` Jacobiator of
the second KdV bracket, or the ``\approx 0.73`` structure-constant violation of the nodal
finite elements — reads as a horizontal line against the sloped ones, which is the honest way
to show that no amount of refinement will fix it.

Pass `guide = q` to draw a dotted ``O(h^q)`` reference line.
