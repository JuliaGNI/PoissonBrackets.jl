    IntegratorMethod

A one-step method for a [`HamiltonianFlow`](@ref).

The methods here are chosen to expose a trade-off rather than to cover the space of
integrators. Three properties are in play — whether the map is Poisson, whether it conserves
the generating Hamiltonian exactly, and whether it conserves the mass — and no method has
all three:

| method | Poisson map | generating `H` | mass |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| [`ImplicitMidpoint`](@ref) | yes, for a constant bracket | only if `H` is quadratic | yes |
| [`AverageVectorField`](@ref) | no | yes, for a constant bracket | yes |
| [`Gonzalez`](@ref), [`GonzalezMass`](@ref) | no | yes, for any `H` | yes |
| [`ExplicitEuler`](@ref), [`RungeKutta4`](@ref) | no | no | yes |
| [`ProjectionMethod`](@ref) | no | yes, by construction | only if asked for |

That no method is both a Poisson map and exactly energy-preserving is the Ge-Marsden
theorem, not a gap in the list: a Poisson integrator that also conserved the Hamiltonian
exactly would reproduce the exact flow up to a reparametrisation of time.

The mass, by contrast, comes free to *every* method here, explicit Euler included, because
its gradient spans the kernel of the first bracket and every increment above lies in that
bracket's range. See [`MassCasimir`](@ref).

    ExplicitEuler()

The explicit Euler method, ``\\hat{u}^{n+1} = \\hat{u}^n + \\Delta t \\, f(\\hat{u}^n)``.

Present as a negative control. It is not a Poisson map, does not conserve energy and is not
even stable here — but it *does* conserve the mass exactly, which is the point: that
conservation is a property of the bracket's kernel and not of the integrator at all.

    RungeKutta4()

The classical explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta method — the non-geometric reference.

Neither a Poisson map nor energy-preserving, and only conditionally stable. Both linearised
fields here have essentially imaginary spectra, so the relevant limit is the imaginary-axis
one, ``|\lambda| \Delta t \le 2\sqrt{2}``, and the spectral radius grows like ``h^{-3}``
through the third derivative; see [`stability_limit`](@ref). Inside that limit the method is
very slightly dissipative, ``|R(iy)| < 1``, so the invariants do not merely wander, they
decay.

    ImplicitMidpoint()

The implicit midpoint rule,
``\hat{u}^{n+1} = \hat{u}^n + \Delta t \, f\!\left(\tfrac{1}{2}(\hat{u}^n +
\hat{u}^{n+1})\right)``.

A **Poisson integrator** whenever the structure matrix is constant. Differentiating the step
implicitly gives the Cayley transform

```math
D\Phi_{\Delta t} = \left( \mathbb{I} - \tfrac{1}{2} \Delta t \, \mathbb{P} H'' \right)^{-1}
                   \left( \mathbb{I} + \tfrac{1}{2} \Delta t \, \mathbb{P} H'' \right) ,
```

and a Cayley transform of ``\mathbb{P}`` times a symmetric matrix preserves ``\mathbb{P}``
exactly, so ``D\Phi \, \mathbb{P} \, D\Phi^T = \mathbb{P}`` to round-off. See
[`tangent_map`](@ref).

It conserves *quadratic* invariants of the differential equation, being symplectic — so it
holds the quadratic ``H_2`` exactly along the second KdV flow. It does not hold the cubic
``H_1`` along the first.

    AverageVectorField()

The average vector field method with a two-point Gauß rule along the segment,

```math
\hat{u}^{n+1} = \hat{u}^n + \Delta t \int_0^1
    f\!\left( \hat{u}^n + \tau \, \Delta \hat{u} \right) d\tau ,
```

exact here because both vector fields are quadratic in ``\hat{u}``.

For a **constant** structure matrix, averaging the vector field and averaging only the
gradient are the same thing, the averaged gradient is a discrete gradient, and
``\bar{g}^T \mathbb{P} \bar{g} = 0`` by antisymmetry — so the method conserves the
generating Hamiltonian exactly, cubic or not.

!!! warning "Not energy-preserving for a variable structure matrix"
    Once ``\mathbb{P}`` depends on ``\hat{u}`` the two readings part company and the
    identity fails: what the method contracts the averaged gradient against is
    ``\int_0^1 \mathbb{P}(\xi) \, \partial H/\partial \hat{u} (\xi) \, d\tau``, and the
    average of a product is not the product of the averages. Along the second KdV flow it
    loses ``H_2``. The remedy is to keep the discrete-gradient form instead —
    [`Gonzalez`](@ref) — which evaluates ``\mathbb{P}`` at a single point.

    Gonzalez()
    GonzalezMass()

The midpoint discrete gradient method of Gonzalez,

```math
\hat{u}^{n+1} = \hat{u}^n + \Delta t \, \mathbb{P}(\bar{u}) \, \bar{g} ,
\qquad
\bar{g} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial \hat{u}} (\bar{u})
        + \frac{\Delta H - \left\langle \partial H/\partial \hat{u} (\bar{u}),
                \Delta \hat{u} \right\rangle}
               {\left\langle \Delta \hat{u}, c \right\rangle} \, c ,
```

with ``\bar{u} = \tfrac{1}{2}(\hat{u}^n + \hat{u}^{n+1})`` and
``\Delta \hat{u} = \hat{u}^{n+1} - \hat{u}^n``.

The rank-one correction is what makes ``\bar{g}`` a *discrete gradient*, i.e. what makes
``\bar{g} \cdot \Delta\hat{u} = \Delta H`` hold exactly; energy conservation then follows
from the antisymmetry of ``\mathbb{P}`` alone, for any Hamiltonian. For a **quadratic**
Hamiltonian the correction vanishes identically and the method reduces to the plain midpoint
rule — which is where the name comes from.

The two variants differ in the direction ``c`` of the correction:

  - `Gonzalez` takes ``c = \Delta\hat{u}``, the Euclidean choice;
  - `GonzalezMass` takes ``c = \mathbb{M} \Delta\hat{u}``, the mass metric.

The discrete-gradient property fixes only the component of the correction along
``\Delta\hat{u}``, so any ``c`` with ``\langle \Delta\hat{u}, c\rangle \ne 0`` will do. The
Euclidean choice is equivariant only under Euclidean-orthogonal changes of variables,
whereas the symmetry group of the problem is ``\mathbb{M}``-orthogonal — which is the
argument for the second variant. In practice the correction it changes is ``O(\Delta t^2)``
either way and the two agree to a few per cent; both are kept because the comparison is the
point.

    ProjectionMethod(base, invariants)

A `base` method followed by a projection onto the level sets of `invariants`,

```math
\hat{u}^{n+1} = \tilde{u} + \sum_k \lambda_k \, \frac{\partial I_k}{\partial \hat{u}} ,
```

with the multipliers ``\lambda`` solving ``I_k(\hat{u}^{n+1}) = I_k(\hat{u}^0)`` for every
`k`.

This is how to hold *both* Hamiltonians of a bi-Hamiltonian pair at once, and it is worth
being clear about what it costs and what it means.

  - The correction direction is not mass-neutral, so projecting onto two Hamiltonians alone
    **loses** the Casimir. Pass the mass as a third invariant and all three are held at once.
  - The projected map is no longer Poisson.
  - More fundamentally, pinning the second Hamiltonian to its initial value enforces
    something the *semi-discrete* flow itself violates, at exactly the size the projection
    removes. Exact conservation of both is therefore available, but as a label attached to
    the trajectory rather than as a property inherited from the continuous bi-Hamiltonian
    structure.

    default_f_abstol(T, ndofs, û₀ = nothing)

The residual tolerance for the Newton iteration,
``4 \, \max(8, N) \, \varepsilon \, \lVert \hat{u}_0 \rVert_\infty``.

The tolerance is **absolute**, so it has to sit above the round-off floor of the residual —
and that floor scales with both the number of degrees of freedom, which is how many terms
accumulate error, and the *amplitude* of the field. Getting either wrong is expensive in a
different direction, and both were measured on implicit midpoint on the second KdV flow:

| tolerance | ``\lVert u \rVert \approx 4`` | ``\lVert u \rVert \approx 1`` |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ``\max(8,N)\varepsilon`` | 40 iterations, never converges | 40 iterations, never converges |
| **this** | **3.0 iterations** | **2.5 iterations** |
| ``16 \times`` this | 2.9 iterations, ``H_2`` error ``10\times`` worse | 2.0 iterations |

Below the floor Newton reaches its limit in three iterations and then spins to the iteration
cap making no progress, reporting non-convergence on a step it has in fact solved. Above it,
Newton stops early and the conservation laws pay: at ``10^{-11}`` the drift in ``H_2`` is
``170\times`` larger. Neither is a tolerable trade in a package whose subject is exact
conservation, and the window between them is not wide — hence a formula rather than a
constant.

Pass `û₀` to [`Integrator`](@ref) so the amplitude is known; without it the factor is one,
which is right for a field of order one and too tight for anything much larger.

    Integrator(flow, method, Δt; kwargs...)

A one-step integrator for `flow`, with its nonlinear solver built **once** and reused across
every step.

```jldoctest
julia> sys = KdVSystem(SplineSpace(16, 3));

julia> integ = Integrator(sys.flow1, ImplicitMidpoint(), 1e-3);

julia> û = project(sys.space, sin); integrate_step!(û, integ); length(û)
16
```

The solver is a `SimpleSolvers.NewtonSolver` with an analytic Jacobian. Its `refactorize`
option is the quasi-Newton scheme these problems want: the Jacobian is factorised once and
reused, and refactorised only when the residual stops decreasing. That matters because an
assembly costs ``O(N^2 Q)``, and at the resolutions and step counts used here it is the
whole run time.

# Keyword arguments

  - `refactorize = 5`: Newton iterations between Jacobian factorisations.
  - `linesearch = Static(T)`: no line search, i.e. a full Newton step, which is what the
    problem wants at these step sizes and is measurably faster than the default
    `Backtracking`.
  - `fallback_linesearch = Backtracking(T)`: used to *redo* a step whose first attempt did
    not converge. See [`_step!`](@ref).
  - `linear_solver_method = LapackLU()`: a LAPACK-backed factorisation. SimpleSolvers'
    own scalar `LU` accounted for 74 % of an implicit step at `N = 384`; see
    [`LapackLU`](@ref).
  - `f_abstol = 1e-13`, `max_iterations = 40`: passed through to the solver's options.
  - any other `SimpleSolvers.Options` keyword.

    _step!(û, method, integrator)

One implicit step: a full Newton step first, and a line search only if that fails.

The fast path is `SimpleSolvers.Static` — no line search — because at these
step sizes the residual is a small perturbation of the identity and Newton converges in two
or three iterations from the previous state, so a backtracking search spends several extra
residual evaluations per iteration probing a step length that is accepted at one.

It is not always enough. On the large-amplitude Miura initial condition, implicit midpoint on
the second flow fails to reach the tolerance on about 1 % of its steps. Measured, those steps
land on the same state to every digit that matters — a line search changes the final field by
less than ``10^{-4}`` relative over four hundred steps — so the failures are consequence-free
here. That is a statement about one problem, though, not a guarantee, and a run that silently
accepts unconverged steps has no way to tell the two apart.

So the step is *redone* from ``\hat{u}^n`` with `fallback_linesearch` when the first attempt
does not converge, and only a failure of both is warned about. The cost is paid on the
1 % of steps that need it rather than on all of them.

The relative defect of the Poisson-map property,

relevant one. ``\rho`` grows like ``h^{-3}`` through the third derivative, which is why an
explicit method needs so many more steps than an implicit one at the same resolution.
